      "Your access to submission nodes (alternatively called login nodes) for Nexus computational resources is determined by your account sponsor's department, center, or lab affiliation.  You can log into the UMIACS Directory CR application and select the Computational Resource (CR) in the list that has the prefix nexus.  The Hosts section lists your available submission nodes - generally a pair of nodes of the format nexus<department, lab, or center abbreviation>[00,01], e.g., nexusgroup00 and nexusgroup01.\n",
      "Note - UMIACS requires multi-factor authentication through our Duo instance.  This is completely discrete from both UMD's and CSD's Duo instances.  You will need to enroll one or more devices to access resources in UMIACS, and will be prompted to enroll when you log into the Directory application for the first time.\n",

      "For resources, you may need to specify --time for time, --ntasks for CPUs, --mem for RAM, and --gres=gpu for GPUs in your submission arguments to meet your requirements.  There are defaults for all four, so if you don't specify something, you may be scheduled with a very minimal set of time and resources (e.g., by default, NO GPUs are included if you do not specify --gres=gpu).  For more information about submission flags for GPU resources, see  here.  You can also can run man srun on your submission node for a complete list of available submission arguments.\n",

These are normally important screens to pay attention to on the internet as a whole and UMIACS goes to great lengths to maintain a secure environment for our users.  However, it is not cost effective to provide commercial certs for all our public facing certificates.  In order to keep costs down we provide a UMIACS CA (certificate authority) that enables your web browser to trust our secure webpages. The following steps explain how to import this certificate based on your preferred web browser.\\n\\nWindows\\nFor most Windows browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer), certificate authorities are handled by Windows itself. These are the steps required to accept the certificate:\\n\\nClick UMIACS Certificate Authority to download the file.\\nOpen the file and click \"Install Certificate\".\\n\\nIn the dialog box opened, click \"Next\".\\nChoose \"Place all certificates in the following store\".\\nChoose \"Browse\", in the dialog box opened, Choose \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" and click \"Ok\".\\n\\nClick \"Next\" and then \"Finish\".\\nIf you get a Security Warning asking if you want to install this certificate, click \"Yes\".\\n\\nYou should receive a success message similar to the following:\\n\\nYou may need to restart your browser for the change to take effect.\\n\\n\\nSafari and Google Chrome (macOS)\\nFor most macOS browsers (excluding Firefox), certificate authorities are handled by macOS itself.

Having BitLocker integrated with the operating system addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.\\nData on a lost or stolen computer is vulnerable to unauthorized access, either by running a software-attack tool against it or by transferring the computer\\'s hard disk to a different computer. BitLocker helps mitigate unauthorized data access by enhancing file and system protections. BitLocker also helps render data inaccessible when BitLocker-protected computers are decommissioned or recycled.\\nOfficial Microsoft documentation can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview\\n\\nBitLocker at UMIACS\\nAll of our supported personal office workstations as well all  enterprise or base-supported laptops and home machines will have BitLocker enabled by UMIACS staff as part of each machine\\'s install process.\\n\\nRecovery Key Prompts\\nOrdinarily, no interaction should be required with BitLocker to keep it in a functional state. However, a few circumstances may lead to BitLocker detecting changes to the system boot information and prevent the computer from reaching Windows. This is by design.\\n\\nSome factors that may cause this (not exhaustive):\\n\\nBIOS or firmware updates -- some manufacturer automatic driver update utilities include these by default - beware!\\nDVDs or USB drives inserted or plugged in during boot\\nMalware on the system\\n\\n\\nThe first step should always be to disconnect any external devices and then power the machine off and back on. This ensures that the hardware configuration of the machine is the same as it was when UMIACS staff initially enabled BitLocker. If the prompt still pops up, please contact UMIACS staff for further troubleshooting.\\n\\nTemporarily Suspending Bitlocker\\nIn the event that you encounter the recovery screen above, after booting back into Windows, follow these steps to ensure the prompt does not appear on subsequent reboots. The first two steps can also be taken proactively if you know you will be making a change that affects BitLocker. (see above)\\n\\nSearch for BitLocker in the Start menu and click on \"Manage BitLocker\".\\n\\nClick \"Suspend protection\" on the Operating system drive and hit yes to the confirmation prompt.\\n\\nIf you are doing something to the computer that would ordinarily trigger BitLocker recovery, perform that operation now. Then after you boot back into Windows, click \"Resume protection\".\\n\\nBitLocker will resume and commit the current boot configuration.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BitLocker&oldid=11219\"',\n",

If you are already using Slot 2 on your YubiKey, slot 1 can still be used.\\n\\nInsert your portable hard drive into any USB slot and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.\\n\\nExpand Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go by clicking the arrow on the right and then click Turn on BitLocker on the portable hard drive.\\n\\nBitLocker will initialize for a few seconds and then pop up with a menu asking how you want to unlock the drive. Choose Use a password to unlock the drive and physically touch the YubiKey\\'s sensor for 3 seconds to get it to output the password you configured previously in each password field.\\n\\nThe menu should automatically advance to asking how you want to back up the recovery key. The recovery key is the only way to get into the encrypted drive if you lose the YubiKey. We strongly recommend the Save to a file option for reasons that we will get into. If you choose to print out the recovery key, store it somewhere safe such as a safe deposit box.\\n\\nPlug in your first USB flash drive and choose to save the file on it.\\n\\nIf you previously had anything saved on your portable hard drive before formatting it as part of the prerequisites, choose to Encrypt entire drive. This is the safest way to ensure everything on the drive is protected. Otherwise (if this is a brand new blank drive), leave the default option of Encrypt used disk space only.\\n\\nLeave the default of Compatible mode to better ensure the files on the encrypted drive will be readable from other devices (which may be running earlier versions of Windows) if need be.\\n\\nContinue through the menus and finally choose to Start encrypting.\\n\\nBitLocker will begin encrypting and a separate window will pop up to show you the status. This step will either take a long time if you chose to Encrypt entire drive, or complete very quickly if you chose to Encrypt used disk space only. You do not have to wait for encryption to complete to proceed with the remaining steps, but you do need to wait for encryption to complete before disconnecting the portable hard drive from the machine.\\n\\nDownload the portable version of KeePassXC Password Manager. Then extract it to your USB flash drive.\\n\\nLaunch KeePassXC.exe from the extracted folder and choose to Create new database.\\n\\nChoose descriptive phrases for the Database Name and Description and click Continue.\\n\\nLeave all the options on the next menu at default unless you know what you are doing and have good reason to change them and click Continue.\\n\\nChoose a memorable password and click Done.\\n\\nChoose to save the file on your USB flash drive.\\n\\nIn your newly created database, choose to Add a new entry from the top pane.\\n\\nMake the Title something memorable. Open the recovery key text file saved earlier, copy the Identifier into the Username field and the Recovery Key into the Password/Repeat fields. Leave some descriptive text in the Notes section to help clarify which fields are which of the BitLocker attributes. Click OK and then exit out of the database back on the main menu.\\n\\nDelete the recovery key text file permanently (NOT the database file you just created). If you leave the recovery key text file on the USB drive, your encrypted portable hard drive is only as secure as that USB flash drive is, rather than needing both the USB flash drive and the password for the database to access the recovery key.\\n\\n(Optional) Copy the contents of the first USB flash drive onto one or more additional USB flash drives to safeguard against loss of both the YubiKey and any single USB flash drive.\\nClearly label the USB flash drive(s) and store them somewhere secure, such as a safe deposit box. If you have multiple USB flash drives, store them separately.\\nYour portable hard drive is now securely BitLocker-encrypted, with one or more USB drives serving as access to the recovery key.\\n\\n\\nUnlocking the drive\\nUnlocking the drive with the YubiKey\\nTo later unlock the drive from the same or a different computer:\\n\\nPhysically plug the drive and YubiKey in. Click on the notification you get in the notification area, which will open the unlock menu.\\n\\nPhysically touch the YubiKey\\'s sensor for 3 seconds to get it to emit the password. It will automatically unlock afterwards.\\n\\nThe drive is now unlocked until it is unplugged again.\\n\\n\\nUnlocking the drive with the recovery password\\nTo later unlock the drive from the same or a different computer if you are not in possession of your YubiKey:\\n\\nPhysically plug one of your USB flash drives containing a database with the recovery key in.\\nOpen the recovery database using the password you set for it and then copy the password for the entry inside of it. This is the recovery key.\\n\\nPhysically plug the drive in. Click on the notification you get in the notification area, which will open the unlock menu.\\n\\nClick on More options and then Enter recovery key.\\n\\nEnter the copied recovery key from your database file and click Unlock.\\n\\nThe drive is now unlocked until it is unplugged again. If you have lost your YubiKey, we strongly recommend buying a new YubiKey, decrypting BitLocker on the drive, and then repeating the initial procedure to re-encrypt it with the new YubiKey.\\n\\n\\nExtra configuration\\nSet up Auto-unlock\\nBitLocker has the ability to auto-unlock an encrypted drive for a specific user(s) when plugged into a specific computer(s) if so desired. This creates an entry in the Windows registry on each computer\\'s local data storage for each user you turn it on for. The entry stores a copy of the volume master key for the encrypted drive that is itself encrypted with a combination of the user\\'s username and either the user\\'s password, if there is one, or computer credentials.\\nWe do not recommend turning this on as it undermines the concept of separation of the unlock methods for the drive from any specific computer. If you do want to turn this on, please ensure the user account(s) that you turn it on for are secure (i.e. have sufficiently complex passwords) and the computer(s) that you turn it on for are in secure locations.\\nTo enable auto-unlock for a drive (per user per computer):\\n\\nInsert your already-encrypted portable hard drive into any USB slot, unlock it, and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.\\n\\nExpand Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go by clicking the arrow on the right and then click Turn on auto-unlock on the portable hard drive.\\n\\nThe drive will now auto-unlock when plugged into the computer you are currently on for your user account only. You can turn it off again by clicking on the Turn off auto-unlock option that appears in the same location after clicking the turn on button.\\n\\n\\nUse an encrypted drive as a backup drive\\nOne of the more useful things you may want to do with a BitLocker-encrypted portable hard drive is set up automatic backup to it. This can be done by following the procedure on  this page, though please note you will need to unlock the drive each time when plugging it into a computer, or have configured auto-unlock for that computer, before it is accessible by backup software.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BitLocker/PersonalUse&oldid=10837\"',\n",

Faculty may request that a class be supported by following the instructions  here.\\n\\nGetting an account\\nYour TA or instructor will request an account for you. Once this is done, you will be notified by email that you have an account to redeem.  If you have not received an email, please contact your TA or instructor. You must redeem the account within 7 days or else the redemption token will expire.  If your redemption token does expire, please contact your TA or instructor to have it renewed.\\nOnce you do redeem your account, you will need to wait until you get a confirmation email that your account has been installed.  This is typically done once a day on days that the University is open for business.\\nAny questions or issues with your account, storage, or cluster use must first be made through your TA or instructor.\\n\\nRegistering for Duo\\nUMIACS requires that all Class accounts register for MFA (multi-factor authentication) under our Duo instance (note that this is different than UMD\\'s general Duo instance). You will not be able to log onto the class submission host until you register.\\nIf you see the following error in your SSH client, you have not yet enrolled/registered in Duo.\\n\\nAccess is not allowed because you are not enrolled in Duo. Please contact your organization\\'s IT help desk.\\n\\nIn order to register, visit our directory app and log in with your Class username and password. You will then receive a prompt to enroll in Duo. For assistance in enrollment, please visit our  Duo help page.\\nOnce notified that your account has been installed and you have registered in our Duo instance, you can SSH to nexusclass.umiacs.umd.edu with your assigned username and your chosen password to log in to a submission host.\\nIf you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:\\n\\nnexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nnexusclass01.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\n\\nCleaning up your account before the end of the semester\\nClass accounts for a given semester are liable to be archived and deleted after that semester\\'s completion as early as the following:\\n\\nWinter semesters: February 1st of same year\\nSpring semesters: June 1st of same year\\nSummer semesters: September 1st of same year\\nFall semesters: January 1st of next year\\n\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure you have backed up anything you want to keep from your class account\\'s personal or group storage (below sections) prior to the relevant date.\\n\\nPersonal Storage\\nYour home directory has a quota of 30GB and is located at:\\n\\n/fs/classhomes/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>\\n\\nwhere <semester> is either \"spring\", \"summer\", \"fall\", or \"winter\", <year> is the current year e.g., \"2021\",  <coursecode> is the class\\' course code as listed in UMD\\'s Schedule of Classes in all lowercase e.g., \"cmsc999z\", and <username> is the username mentioned in the email you received to redeem the account e.g., \"c999z000\".\\nYou can request up to another 100GB of personal storage if you would like by having your TA or instructor  contact staff. This storage will be located at\\n\\n/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>\\n\\nGroup Storage\\nYou can also request group storage by having your TA or instructor  contact staff to specify the usernames of the accounts that should be in the group. Only other class accounts in the same class can be added to the group. The quota will be 100GB multiplied by the number of accounts in the group and will be located at\\n\\n/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<groupname>\\n\\nwhere <groupname> is composed of:\\n\\nthe abbreviated course code as used in the username e.g., \"c999z\"\\nthe character \"g\"\\nthe number of the group (starting at 0 for the first group for the class requested to us) prepended with 0s to make the total group name 8 characters long\\n\\n\\ne.g., \"c999zg00\".\\n\\nCluster Usage\\nYou may not run computational jobs on any submission host.  You must  schedule your jobs with the SLURM workload manager.  You can also find out more with the public documentation for the SLURM Workload Manager.\\nClass accounts only have access to the following submission parameters in SLURM:\\n\\n--partition - class\\n--account - class\\n--qos - default, medium, and high\\n\\n\\nYou must specify at least the partition parameter manually in any submission command you run. If you do not specify any QoS parameter, you will receive the QoS default.\\nYou can view the resource limits for each QoS by running the command show_qos. The value in the MaxWall column is the maximum runtime you can run a single job for each QoS, and the values in the MaxTRES column are the maximum amount of CPU cores/GPUs/memory you can request for a single job using each QoS.\\nPlease note that you will be restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM across all jobs you have running at once. This can be viewed with the command show_partition_qos.\\n\\nExample\\nHere is a basic example to schedule a interactive job running bash with a single GPU in the partition class, with the account class, running with the QoS of default and the default CPU/memory allocation/time limit for the partition.\\n\\nbash-4.4$ hostname\\nnexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nbash-4.4$ srun --partition=class --account=class --qos=default --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash\\nsrun: Job time limit was unset; set to partition default of 60 minutes\\nsrun: job 1333337 queued and waiting for resources\\nsrun: job 1333337 has been allocated resources\\n\\nbash-4.4$ hostname\\ntron14.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nbash-4.4$ nvidia-smi -L\\nGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-55f2d3b7-9162-8b02-50de-476a012c626c)\\n\\nAvailable Nodes\\nYou can list the available nodes and their current state with the show_nodes -p class command.

Each class will need to have the faculty member or TA(s) as the point of contacts for the class.  All students within the class will need to raise issues or questions through these points of contact who can relay or request support through our HelpDesk.  Please refer to the ClassAccounts documentation for further information.\\n\\nRequest New Class\\nIf you are a faculty member teaching a class and want to use our resources, send email to staff@umiacs.umd.edu to create a ticket.  Please list or CC your TA(s) and what course you are teaching.  UMIACS staff will confirm the course through UMD Testudo and create the class within our Requests application.  We will associate you and your TA(s) with the class to be able to manage it through this application.  If your TAs do not have existing UMIACS accounts, please sponsor  collaborator accounts for each of them.\\nPlease also mention any special storage allocation(s) you may need in your request.\\nOnce the class is created, you and your TAs may want to create class accounts for yourselves (which is allowed).  This ensures you see the steps that students will see when getting their account(s) and give you the ability to test and manage any local resources for the class.\\n\\nManagement of Accounts\\nOnce the class is created, accounts go through the following lifecycle.\\n\\nFaculty/TAs create requests in our Requests application with the class dashboard.  This is done by entering a form with one or more email addresses.  We only support creating accounts for @umd.edu and @terpmail.umd.edu addresses.\\nOnce a request for a student has been created from this email address, the student receives an email with a URL including a token that is only good for 7 days. Once they click this URL, they will be taken to a page to redeem their account by entering some information about themselves and selecting a password for their account.\\nIf the student does not redeem their account, Faculty/TAs can go into the student\\'s class account request in the app and renew their token.  This will invalidate the old token and issue a new token and then send a new email for account redemption.\\n\\n\\nAccounts that are redeemed will show up as pending in the Accounts Installed section of the class dashboard.  UMIACS Technical Staff will install class accounts that have been redeemed once per business day.  Once the account(s) are installed, they will be listed as installed on the class dashboard.  Each student will receive an email with information on getting started with their class account.\\nNote that class accounts also need to setup Duo multi-factor authentication in order to access the cluster.  Otherwise, they will see the message Access is not allowed because you are not enrolled in Duo. Please contact your organization\\'s IT help desk. when trying to SSH to the class account login nodes.  Have them follow the instructions  here.\\nIf a student does not provide a phone number when they redeem their account, they will not be able to reset their password automatically in the event that they forget it.  In this case, the TA will need to  contact staff and staff will advise on the steps.\\n\\n\\nFaculty/TAs will need to communicate any special instructions or information with their students on how to use the computational resources.\\n\\n\\nDeletion of Class\\nWe will notify and clean up all class accounts after each major semester\\'s completion. Class accounts are liable to be archived and deleted as early as follows:\\n\\nWinter semesters: February 1st of same year\\nSpring semesters: June 1st of same year\\nSummer semesters: September 1st of same year\\nFall semesters: January 1st of next year\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=ClassAccounts/Manage&oldid=10785\"',\n",

In the context of a cluster job, the data being processed, as well as any generated results, should be stored on a disk physically installed in the compute node itself.  We\\'ll cover how to identify local disk space later on this page.\\n\\nGeneral Workflow\\nThe following is a suggested workflow for a computational job:\\n\\nCopy the data to be processed to local disk space of the compute node(s) your job is assigned.\\nProcess the data, storing results on local disk space.\\nOnce processing is finished, transfer results to permanent storage location. (i.e., a network file share)\\nClean up data and results from local disk space of the compute node(s) your job is assigned.\\n\\n\\nWhy this matters\\nSimilar to how running too many processes on a single machine can slow it down, too many users accessing shares on a network file server can impact performance of that file server.  This issue is further compounded in the context of cluster jobs, as a single user can generate hundreds if not thousands of jobs all trying to access the same network file server.  By utilizing the local disks on the compute nodes, you effectively distribute the data access load and reduce the load on the file server.\\nFollowing these best practices isn\\'t just about being a good neighbor however, they will also improve the performance of your jobs.\\nTo further illustrate this issue, consider a service like Netflix.  While Netflix invests heavily in their data storage and supporting network, if they allowed their customers to access it directly it would quickly reach capacity resulting in performance degradation for all users.  In order to accommodate this, Netflix distributes its data into various caching tiers, which are much closer to the end user.  This distribution evens the load across multiple different devices, increasing the performance and availability for all users.\\nWhile UMIACS obviously does not operate at the same scale as Netflix, the same concepts are still present within the compute infrastructure.  Processing data that resides on local disk space reduces the load on the central file server and improves the performance of the process.\\n\\nData Storage\\nWhen possible, it is recommended that data be stored in an archive file when not actively being processed (i.e., before initiating inbound/outbound transfers to/from local disk space).\\nUtilizing archive files provide the following benefits:\\n\\nFaster data transfers\\nReduced data size\\nEasier data management\\n\\n\\nPractically every filesystem in existence has limitations in its ability to handle large numbers of small files.  By grouping large collections of small files into a single archive file, you can reduce the impact of this limitation, as well as improve the efficiency of data storage when combined with techniques such as compression.  Another advantage manifests when transferring data over the network.  In order to transfer a file, a connection to the remote location has to be established and closed for each file, which can add significant overhead when dealing with large numbers of files.  When the files are collected into a single archive file, you reduce the number of connections that are created and destroyed, and focus more on streaming data.  \\nCommon utilities for creating archive files are tar and zip.\\n\\nIdentifying Local Disk Space\\nLocal disk space at UMIACS typically conforms to the following guidelines:\\n\\nDirectory name starts with /scratch\\nAlmost every UMIACS supported machine has a /scratch0\\nMachines with multiple local disks may have multiple /scratchX directories, where X is a number that increases with the number of disks\\n\\n\\nExample, with output shortened for brevity:\\n\\n$ lsblk \\nNAME               MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\\nsda                  8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk\\n└─sda2               8:2    0 930.5G  0 part\\n  ├─vol00-scratch0 253:3    0   838G  0 lvm  /scratch0\\nsdb                  8:16   0   477G  0 disk\\n└─sdb1               8:17   0   477G  0 part /scratch1\\nsdc                  8:32   0 953.9G  0 disk\\n└─sdc1-scratch2    253:2    0 953.9G  0 lvm  /scratch2\\n\\nLocal disk space is considered transitory and as such is not backed up.  It is not intended for long-term storage of critical/sensitive data.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the available local disk space on a given cluster, please refer to the documentation specific for that cluster, or contact  the UMIACS Help Desk.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Compute/DataLocality&oldid=12074\"',\n",

It is simple to set up and highly customizable. At UMIACS, it is the software we recommend to users looking to either record or stream on either their personal computers or in a conference room or auditorium setting.\\n\\nConference Quick Setup\\nBelow are steps outlining how to start recording or streaming your meetings. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk. \\n\\nSelect the source you\\'d like to route to the computer via the \"Shared Media\" option on the Crestron control panel. This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.\\nDownload (windows zip file) and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.\\nSet up video.\\nClick the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.\\nEnsure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called \\'AV Bridge\\'.\\nClick OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.\\nIf the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack\\'s default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.\\n\\n\\nEnsure audio settings look OK.\\nThe default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.\\nKeep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.\\n\\n\\nSet up either streaming, recording, or both as follows.\\n\\n\\nStreaming:\\n\\nGo to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).\\nLocate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this.\\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard, near the bottom\\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings, at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.\\n\\n\\nEnter your key and hit OK.\\nClick Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom.\\n\\n\\nRecording:\\n\\nGo to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive. We have observed that using external HDDs may introduce dropped frames due to encoding lag because of I/O bottlenecks.\\nClick Start Recording under the Control pane at the bottom.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=ConferenceRooms/Recording&oldid=10082\"',\n",

This will turn on the display(s) for the room and lower the projector screens if any are present.\\n\\nOnce the startup completes, you will see a number of different options depending on what the capabilities of the room are:\\n\\n Moderated Rooms\\n\\nThese (larger) rooms have a number of options for sources to display and multiple places to display them to. All of the source options available in the smaller conference rooms are also available in these rooms. The exact options on each moderated room\\'s panel may vary, as the capabilities vary room to room.\\nOf note in these rooms specifically is the \"Device Control\" option at the top of the source/destination menu, which takes you to another menu where you can manage volume, and (in some rooms) lighting, microphones, and settings for other integrated devices such as the room\\'s Blu-ray player, TV tuner, or room cameras. This is also where you mute or unmute the lectern mic, if there is one.\\n\\n\\n Auto-Accept Rooms\\n\\nThese rooms have the ability to display an external device\\'s screen wirelessly using  Solstice, an external device\\'s screen wired via HDMI, or the room PC\\'s screen (the room PC is attached to the back of the display in the room).\\n\\n Huddle Rooms\\n\\nThese rooms have the ability to display an external device\\'s screen wirelessly using  Solstice or wired via HDMI. They do not have room PCs, so you must bring your own device(s).\\n\\nCommon Options\\nThe three source options you will commonly choose from on these panels are \"Solstice\", \"Laptop Device\" (just \"Laptop\" on some panels), and \"Room PC\" (the third option only in non-huddle rooms).\\nIn auto-accept and huddle rooms, the volume control for each of these sources can be found one you select that source. In moderated rooms, the volume control is on the Device Control menu, as mentioned above.\\n\\nSolstice\\n\\nThis option will prompt you to look at the display in the room for instructions on how to display your device(s) to the room\\'s display wirelessly. More specific instructions can be found  here. Note that the room-specific details (IP address, room code) have been blacked out in the below photo for privacy reasons, but will show properly when you are physically in a room.\\n\\n\\nLaptop Device\\n\\nConnect your device to either the HDMI cable or VGA/aux cables coming out of the middle of the desk in the room to display your device to the room\\'s display over a wired connection.\\n\\nRoom PC\\n\\nUse the wireless keyboard/mouse combo on the desk in the room to use the room PC. Choose the Conference account to sign into, which does not need a password. Please be sure to log off when you are done using the room PC, as the account is fully wiped when you log off, ensuring the next group using the room does not have access to anything you may have signed into.\\n\\nShutting Down\\nPlease be sure to touch the \"Shutdown A/V System\" button when you are done using the room to save energy and give the next group using the room a clean slate.

You can copy data between the different types of data storage listed below, but it may be unnecessarily cumbersome if you don\\'t choose the right place for the \"master copy\" of your data.\\n\\n Local data storage is best suited for data that you are actively working on. Some examples are code that you are developing or using (perhaps to run computational jobs in SLURM with), results from computational jobs that have already run but have not yet been published in a paper, or files that need to be processed by another desktop-based or server-based application.\\nData on UMIACS\\' local storage can be moved between different UMIACS-supported hosts and shared with other  UMIACS account holders using common methods such as cp, File Explorer, Finder, and more.\\n\\n\\n UMIACS\\' Object Store is best suited for data that is going to remain static, but needs to remain accessible for very long periods of time, such as data referenced by published papers. It is also suitable for transferring specific versions of data in and out of UMIACS via large singular files, such as archive (tar/zip/etc.) files.\\nData in UMIACS\\' Object Store can be moved in and out of it, to local storage (whether UMIACS\\' or otherwise), via its web interface or one of many  compatible clients. Data can be shared publicly via simple download links or  static websites that can visualize the data in a more accessible way. UMIACS account holders can sponsor  Collaborator accounts for external collaborators that may need to upload and download new versions of data without needing direct access to UMIACS-supported hosts.\\n\\n\\n Cloud data storage is best suited for collaborative data, such as simple or rich text documents, PDF forms, spreadsheets, presentations, pictures, videos, and more. Many cloud storage service providers also provide web-based apps attached to their storage service that can be used to edit these types of data without ever having to download it to a specific device.\\nThe methods that can be used to move data in and out of cloud storage to local storage vary based on the specific service provider, but often involve web-based or mobile app-based upload and download.

       " 'Data Transfer\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nDepending on the amount of data you are trying to transfer there are different commands that you should use.  The classic cp command has a number of edge cases in which it will not copy everything that is expected, so the only time that one should use the cp command is if the copy can be verified, such as if you are moving a single file. The better choice for transferring data is by using tar or gtar.  After transferring files or directories, you can use rsync to check that everything moved correctly and to perform a final sync on changed files.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Transfer a single file\\n2 Transfer a directory or large amounts of data to another location\\n\\n2.1 Transfer between two different hosts\\n\\n\\n3 Verifying transfer\\n\\n\\nTransfer a single file\\nIf you want to transfer a single file into another directory you can use the cp command.  The format for the cp command is: cp Source Destination. If destination is omitted, it will make a copy of the file(s) in the current directory.\\n\\nTo copy the file foo.txt into your home directory\\'s Documents directory\\n\\n\\ncp foo.txt ~/Documents\\nTo transfer the file foo.txt from your current directory to another host use scp (secure copy) with <USERNAME>@<FQDN>:<PATH>\\n\\n\\nscp foo.txt USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/Documents\\nThis command will copy the file foo from your current directory to the folder Documents located in your home directory on the host example1. \\n\\nTo transfer back the file foo.txt from the host example1 to another directory in your current host\\n\\n\\nscp USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/Documents/foo.txt ~/Videos\\nImportant: The cp command should only be used for small file transfers.  If you try to transfer a large amount it is possible that cp will not copy all the files over properly. To learn more about the cp command type man cp on the in the terminal.\\n\\nTransfer a directory or large amounts of data to another location\\nIf you want to transfer a whole directory or a large amount of data to another location you can use the gtar command.\\n\\nTo combine two files in your current directory in an archive: gtar -cpvf archive.tar file1 file2\\n\\n\\nTo re-archive the data back in a different directory, for example Documents in your home directory: gtar -C ~/Documents/ -xpvf archive.tar\\n\\n\\nThis command will archive all files (including those in subdirectories) within the current directory and re-create the files in the directory that you specify.\\nThe format for the gtar command for data transfer is:\\n\\ngtar -cpf -  . | gtar -C /dir -xpvf -\\nIn this command, the target is a dash \\'-\\' which stands for standard output, and the source is a period \\'.\\' which is interpreted as all files in your current directory. The standard output is piped to the second command, which has as a source a dash \\'-\\' (which the shell interprets as standard input). The output of the first command is piped and becomes the input of the second command.

       " 'Duo\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nDuo is the multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution for both UMD centralized information technology resources (DivIT) and UMIACS local resources.  Multi-factor solutions ensure that you have something you know (i.e. your password) and something you have (phone/tablet/token) when trying to authenticate.  This ensures that phishing and other attempts to secure your password do not result in an account compromise and protect you and your data from unauthorized access.\\nEnrollment is discrete and must be done for both UMD (if you have a UMD appointment) and UMIACS individually.  You can enroll the same phone for both of these services, but not the same hardware token (if you use a token for UMD already).  The UMIACS Single Sign-On and our VPN require Duo authentication.\\nDo not share a registered Duo authentication factor with any other UMIACS user for any purpose. Action may be taken against your account if you do so.\\n\\n \\n\\nDuo Login Prompt\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Enrollment\\n2 Management\\n3 Offline Use\\n4 Services\\n5 FAQ\\n\\n\\nEnrollment\\nPlease refer to Duo\\'s Enrollment guide which has comprehensive information on how to enroll your devices.  Your initial sign in for enrollment purposes must be done via our Directory application.\\nWe encourage users to enroll with their smart phone as it provides the most seamless experience.  We also support iOS/Android Tablets, landlines, and U2F FIDO authenticator tokens (though these do not work with our VPN or MFA SSH services).\\n\\nManagement\\nUsers can manage their UMIACS Duo settings as part of the required login to the Directory Application.  Please follow the Duo guide for Managing Devices when you see the Duo login prompt.\\nWe suggest you register using a mobile phone or tablet that is always in your personal possession.  If/When you upgrade or dispose of your currently registered phone/tablet, please consider enrolling your new device before getting rid of your old device.  Activation of your new device will require you to successfully authenticate with a currently registered device.  If you no longer have the device but have kept the same phone number, you can select Call Me to have Duo call you to authenticate your session to manage/enroll your devices.  If you do not have access to your previous device(s) or the phone number, you will need to  contact staff for assistance.\\n\\nOffline Use\\n\\nDuo Offline One-Time Code\\n\\nEntering Your Code\\n\\nFor use when phone data or calls are not available, there are 2 options. \\nYou may use the Duo App on their phone or tablet—without any internet connection—to generate one-time codes that will allow you to authenticate to Duo.  This code will be the input for the secondary login screen for the VPN or the passcode option in the Duo pane of web authentication.  To get a code from the app, open the app and tap on the entry labeled \"Duo-protected UMIACS.\"  This will present a 6 digit passcode.\\nAlternatively, YubiKey hardware tokens can be used with Duo. Hardware tokens must be enrolled by the Technical staff, so if you are interested in procuring a hardware token for use with Duo, please  contact staff. We only support registering YubiKey tokens for this purpose, no other hardware token.\\n\\nServices\\nThe following UMIACS services are secured with our Duo MFA solution.\\n\\n\\nGitLab\\nJira\\n Object Storage\\nVPN\\nDirectory\\nRequests\\nMediaWiki log ins\\n SSH (when coming in from off-campus)\\n\\nFAQ\\nI can no longer clone HTTPS Git repositories in GitLab. How do I work around this?\\nSince we now require more than just your username/password to log into GitLab, you cannot use your UMIACS credentials directly for accessing HTTPS Git repositories.  We encourage you to setup an SSH key instead.  If you have a case where you need to use HTTPS, you can use a Personal Access Token to accomplish this.  Ensure that you create the token with API scope.  You would then use your username as normal and use the token as the password.  Treat this token as a personal secret, as it is sufficient to act as your account within GitLab.\\n\\n\\nHow do I authenticate with a Token?\\nWe only currently support YubiKey tokens for our Duo deployment.  You can follow the instructions from Yubico; you will need to tap the YubiKey once you select the Enter a Passcode field.  It will create a passcode (will look something like kffuastenhldrhfhadafdarivuntddugrvjvllddjjuget) and send a return.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Duo&oldid=11954\"',\n",

These can be set in many ways but we will cover the most popular: tcsh and bash. You can see your PATH variable by using the built-in echo command in the shell.  When printing out environment variables you will need to prefix the variable with the $ sign.\\n\\n$ echo $PATH\\n/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin\\n\\nIn almost all cases you will want to append to either the beginning or end of your PATH variable and not replace it fully as this will most likely decrease the functionality of your shell.  For example, if you wanted to add the path /opt/UMtorque/bin to the end of your PATH then you could do the following,\\n\\ntcsh/csh\\nsetenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin\\nbash/sh\\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin\\n\\n\\nThese can be either typed into your shell directly or added to your shell\\'s initialization files so every time you spawn a shell it will get this new PATH.\\n\\nPATH (Windows)\\nTo modify the Windows PATH Environmental Variable do the following: \\n\\nGo to Control Panel and click on User Accounts. Then click on the User Accounts heading within User Accounts.\\nOn the left pane, click Change my environment variables.\\nUnder User Variables for <username> choose the PATH variable.\\nIf there is none, click New and put PATH for the Variable name.\\n\\n\\nClick Edit and append the location you are trying to add. Different paths are separated by semicolons.\\n\\n\\nTo verify that the PATH variable has been modified properly do the following:\\n\\nOpen a new Command Prompt (Start -> Accessories -> Command Prompt).\\nType in PATH.\\n\\n\\nThe updated PATH should be printed.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=EnvironmentalVariables&oldid=10331\"',\n",

These accounts can not create\\nrepositories or groups, but may be given access to your repositories or\\ngroups.  You can find this utility in our Requests application under UMIACS Collaborators.\\n\\nUser Documentation\\nGitLab provides user documentation that can be accessed at https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help\\nSome of the most useful sections include:\\n\\nPermissions and user roles - https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/permissions.md\\nGitLab markdown for wikis and READMEs - https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/markdown.md\\n\\n\\nRepository URLs\\nUsers can clone git repos over either SSH or HTTPS.  We recommend using SSH because it is more convenient for most users.  The blue \"Clone\" button in the upper-right corner of your GitLab project page will contain the clone URL for whichever authentication method you prefer.\\n\\nSSH\\nTo use SSH, add an SSH key to your GitLab account. Instructions to do so can be found here. Once you have the SSH key added, you can authenticate without having to enter any credentials from the machine and account for which you created the SSH key (if your key is not password-protected).\\n\\nHTTPS\\nThe HTTPS URL can be used as well, but you will need to setup Personal Access Tokens in order to connect. Instructions to create one can be found here. Once you have a token, you can use that as your password when prompted. You will have to re-enter your credentials for GitLab every single time that you attempt to commit to, push to, pull from, or otherwise access the remote repository.\\n\\nMake GitLab projects public\\nMaking projects public grants access to everyone. Projects can only made public by the owner. To make your projects on GitLab public, follow the steps below:\\n1. Go to your project page.\\n2. Click on Settings.\\n3. Scroll down to Project Visibility. Choose Public from the drop-down menu.\\n4. Scroll down and click on Save Changes\\n5. Scroll down to Repository under Project Visibility and select Everyone with access from the drop-down menu.\\n6.

The only main difference between the two is that HDMI transfers sound natively, while with VGA you will need to connect an additional 3.5mm audio cable. With either approach, the general steps are as follows:\\n\\nConnect your cable of choice to the device you wish to display on the screen.\\nYou may need an adapter if you are using a laptop.\\n\\n\\nConnect the other end of the cable to the wall port (usually located opposite of the TV).\\n\\nIf you do not see your device automatically appearing on the TV, you may need to turn on the TV or adjust the input of the TV (both done using the remote). \\nIf you do not currently have a remote for your TV, you can get one from the UMIACS Help Desk.\\nTo adjust the input of the TV, click the source button on the remote, located between the volume and channel buttons, and select the proper input named HDMI 1.\\n\\nOnce you connect your device, there are different display modes that can be chosen. Some operating systems may have additional nonstandard options which are described on the individual display mode pages listed below. The following is a description of the basic two modes that all operating systems have:\\n\\nMirror: Displays the same screen on both your computer and the TV.\\nExtend: Will use the TV as a second screen which you can access by moving your mouse off your current display.\\n\\n\\nIf you wish to change your display mode, you can click on the appropriate link below to see a detailed how-to complete with pictures for your particular operating system:\\n\\n Windows Change Display Mode\\n macOS Change Display Mode\\n RHEL Change Display Mode\\n\\nDisplaying Still Images and Playing a Slide Show\\nThere is a USB port on the back of the TV that can be used to display still images or play a slideshow. To be able to follow this guide, you must have a remote which you can pick up from the UMIACS Help Desk if you do not already have one. Now that you have a remote, follow these steps:\\n\\nUpload all of the pictures that you want the TV to display onto a flash drive and plug the flash drive into the USB port on the TV (located around the right edge).\\n\\n\\nClick the source button on the remote and navigate to the MagicInfo S option if it is not already there.\\n\\n\\nYou should now see Player in the top left of your screen.

It provides a unified password space in which we can manage strong passwords easily and it can prevent your password from being sent across the network as cleartext.\\n\\nWorking with Kerberos\\nWhen you successfully log into any of our Kerberos authenticated systems, you will be granted a set of credentials which will identify you to other network resources. Most users can take advantage of Kerberos without any detailed knowledge about the system.\\nThe only significant complication for some users is that credentials expire after one week at UMIACS. In some environments, the lack of credentials can cause the user environment to behave erratically as network resources become unavailable.\\nWhenever possible, we strongly suggest that users log out of their environments nightly.\\n\\nListing your credentials\\nIt is often useful to examine your current credentials. Using klist, you can verify that your login is correct,\\n\\n -bash-4.2$  klist\\n Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg\\n Default principal: username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\n \\n Valid starting     Expires            Service principal\\n 05/28/18 11:39:36  05/28/18 18:19:36  krbtgt/AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\n\\n\\'Default principal\\' indicates the Kerberos identity of the current process. In this case, the Kerberos principal, \\'username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\' indicates that we are authenticated as the user \\'username\\' to the realm \\'AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\'.\\nIf your credentials have not been set up correctly, klist will report:\\n\\n -bash-4.2$  klist\\n klist: No credentials cache found (ticket cache FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg)\\n\\nSingle Sign On Services\\nKerberos authenticated IMAP and SMTP provide secure and convenient methods for sending and reading mail. Unlike traditional IMAP and SMTP services, your password is never sent over the network as cleartext and your password is not cached on a client.\\n\\nPassword Security\\nKerberos security depends on the security of your password. Although Kerberos can make secure access to services convenient, it is still your responsibility to secure your password. Please try to choose a strong password and use secure protocols.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Kerberos&oldid=10385\"',\n",
       " 'KVM\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nKVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although work is underway to get the required changes upstream.\\nUsing KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.\\nThe kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux as of 2.6.20.\\nThe system image for the virtual machine should be on local disk space.  Putting a running virtual machine on networked file space will result in poor performance for both the virtual machine, as well as other users of the filespace.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Getting Started\\n2 Creating a virtual machine\\n\\n2.1 Initializing the machine\\n2.2 Forwarding Ports\\n2.3 Windows Example\\n\\nGetting Started\\nIn order to start using KVM on your machine, UMIACS Staff will first need to install the requisite packages and set a baseline configuration.  Please  contact staff along with a brief explanation of your goals for running a local virtual machine.  Note: Ubuntu requires you to be in the kvm group on the local host.\\nOnce staff has installed the required packages you can then use the program \\'virt-manager\\' to initialize and manager your virtual machines.\\n\\nIn a terminal run:\\n\\n\\nvirt-manager -c qemu:///session\\n\\n\\nThis will bring up a graphical interface which can be used to manage various aspects of your virtual machines.  The network that is available is called usermode networking which provides a NAT connection to the outside world.  See below about forwarding ports using qemu-kvm.\\n\\n\\nCreating a virtual machine\\nInitializing the machine\\nIn virt-manager, highlight \\'localhost\\' and then click the \\'New\\' button.  This will bring up a new window that will guide you through configuring your virtual machine.  For the most part, you should stick with the default options.\\n\\nForwarding Ports\\nThis functionality is only available by editing the XML file for your domain directly.  Libvirt has the capability to pass arguments directly to the qemu binary.  First create your VM with virt-manager and then shut it down.  Run in a shell virsh -c qemu:///session which will drop you into the virsh shell.   You can list your VMs both running and off by typing list --all.  Find the name of the VM and type edit NAME where NAME is the name of the VM.\\nYou need to replace the <domain> tag in the first line to:\\n\\n   <domain type=\\'kvm\\' xmlns:qemu=\\'http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0\\'>\\n\\nThen you need to insert the following lines directly above the last line which should have the </domain> tag.  In this case the port 2222 will be forwarded to the port 22.   You may specify multiple ports here but each needs its own -redir line and the port specifications.\\n\\n   <qemu:commandline>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'-redir\\'/>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'tcp:2222::22\\'/>\\n    </qemu:commandline>\\n\\nHere is an example forwarding 3389 to 3389 (RDP) when running Windows (you may need to activate RDP within your Windows VM).\\n\\n   <qemu:commandline>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'-redir\\'/>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'tcp:3389::3389\\'/>\\n    </qemu:commandline>\\n\\nWindows Example\\nYou can start a windows install with virt-install in a rather automated fashion.  Here is an example using a Windows 10 x64 ISO with 40G disk and 16GB of RAM. Please note that this should spawn virt-viewer automatically and show you the Windows installer screen.\\n\\nvirt-install --connect qemu:///session --name=win10 --os-type=windows --network user --disk path=/scratch0/username/win10.img,size=40 --cdrom=/scratch0/username/Win10x64.iso --graphics spice --ram=16384\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=KVM&oldid=10299\"',\n",

LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.\\n\\nLaTeX on Windows\\nIn Windows, it is highly recommended to use a full-featured suite such as TeX Live or MiKTeX. Both of these suites include everything required for end-to-end LaTeX compilation and filetype conversation. Please contact the HelpDesk for assistance with installing or using these on a UMIACS-supported Windows machine.\\n\\nLaTeX on Linux/UNIX\\nMacTeX is available for macOS.\\nTeX Live is available for Linux.\\nMost of our supported Linux systems come with the LaTeX command-line utilities, as well as TeX Live, installed.\\n\\nChecking installed packages\\nTeX Live comes with tons of packages preinstalled. To get a list of installed packages, you must first load the TeX Live GNU module. You can then use the following command:\\n\\n$ tlmgr list --only-installed\\nIf you know which package you are looking for, you can pipe the output into grep to search for specific packages.\\n\\nCompiling to PDF\\nThe following is an example of compiling example.tex to a PDF.\\n\\n    Compile the file into a DVI file by using the latex command.\\n\\n    $ latex example.tex \\nThis is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2013)\\n[...]\\n[1] (./example.aux) )\\nOutput written on example.dvi (1 page, 1692 bytes).\\nTranscript written on example.log.\\n\\n\\n    Use dvipdfmx to convert example.dvi into a PDF (dvipdf or dvipdfm usually would work as well).\\n\\n    $ dvipdfmx example.dvi\\nexample.dvi -> example.pdf\\n[1]\\n12211 bytes written\\n\\n\\nIf your output PDF does not look quite right, you may need to use different conversion tools.

       " 'LocalDataStorage\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nLocal  (data) storage refers to all data that is stored physically at UMIACS, i.e., on hard drives either in servers in datacenters managed by  UMIACS staff, or in UMIACS-supported workstations. The opposite of this is  cloud storage which is stored on third-party providers\\' data hosting platforms.\\nThe below sections outline the different categories of local storage available at UMIACS. Although technically local storage by the above definition, UMIACS also hosts an  Object Store that is documented outside the scope of this page.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Network Home Directory Local Storage\\n2 UNIX Local Storage\\n3 Windows and macOS Local Storage\\n4 Direct-Attached Local Storage\\n5 Network-Attached Local Storage\\n\\n5.1 Network-Attached Local Scratch Storage\\n\\n\\n6 UNIX Local Storage Commands\\n\\n\\nNetwork Home Directory Local Storage\\nWe provide network home directory local storage to each of our users through NFShomes home directories.\\nThis home directory can be accessed via either\\n\\n   /nfshomes/<username> (NFS)\\n\\nor\\n\\n   \\\\\\\\isilondata.umiacs.umd.edu\\\\nfshomes\\\\<username> (CIFS)\\n\\nand is backed up nightly using the Institute\\'s TSM backup system. It also has Snapshots enabled for easy user restores.\\nUsers are given a 30GB, non-expandable Quota. You will need to use either platform-specific local storage, directly-attached local storage, or other network-attached local storage for increased space.\\nOn user account closure, the account\\'s NFShomes home directory goes into our Archives.\\n\\nUNIX Local Storage\\nUNIX hosts use redundant, backed-up network file shares for user directories (above section). Research data storage (below section) is also stored on redundant, possibly-backed-up network file shares and is generally available under /fs/\\nAll UNIX hosts also have local storage available for transitory use. These directories may be used to store temporary, local COPIES of data that is permanently stored elsewhere or as a staging point for output.\\nThese directories may not, under any circumstances, be used as permanent storage for unique, important data. They are not backed up or archived by UMIACS. UMIACS staff cannot recover damaged or deleted data from these directories and will not be responsible for data loss if they are misused. Additionally, on our SLURM compute clusters, these volumes may have an automated cleanup routine that will delete unmodified data after some number of days. You can check the page for the specific cluster you are using for more information.\\nPlease note that /tmp in particular is at risk for data loss or corruption as that directory is regularly used by system processes and services for temporary storage.\\nThese directories include:\\n\\n - /tmp\\n - /scratch0, /scratch1, ... (/scratch#)\\n - any directory named in whole or in part \"tmp\", \"temp\", or \"scratch\".\\n\\nWindows and macOS Local Storage\\nWindows and macOS hosts at UMIACS store user directories on their primary internal drives (C:\\\\Users for Windows, /Users for macOS). Supported, UMIACS-managed hosts automatically back up user data on these drives nightly using the Institute\\'s TSM backup system. If you have a supported, UMIACS-managed host that has other internal or external hard drives attached to it, or other partitions on its primary internal drive, please be aware that these drives/partitions are not backed up. Laptops and non-standard hosts are not automatically backed up and should be manually backed up by their users.\\nOn host decommission, user directories go into our Archives.\\n\\nDirect-Attached Local Storage\\nDirect-attached local storage refers to devices like USB flash drives and USB hard drives, which are very popular for easily expanding storage capacity on a host. However, these devices are significantly more vulnerable to data loss or theft than internal or networked data storage. In general, UMIACS discourages the use of direct-attached local storage when any other option is available. Please note that these devices are prone to high rates of failure and additional steps should be taken to ensure that the data is backed up and that critical or confidential data is not lost or stolen.\\nDirect-attached local storage is not backed up or archived by UMIACS.\\n\\nNetwork-Attached Local Storage\\nSome labs have network-attached local storage space dedicated for datasets, models, and project storage. These shares are typically named in the form /fs/<lab>-<purpose> (i.e., /fs/cml-models or /fs/vulcan-projects).\\nNetwork-attached local storage may or may not be backed up and/or archived by UMIACS. Details of a specific share\\'s retention policy should be stated along with the documentation of the share\\'s access / usage policy. If you find an  documentation network-attached local storage space in this wiki that does not state its retention policy, please  contact staff.\\n\\nNetwork-Attached Local Scratch Storage\\nOne specific sub-category of network-attached local storage is network-attached local scratch storage. These shares are named similarly to local scratch or temporary storage, but with the lab\\'s name included (i.e., /fs/cbcb-scratch or /gammascratch), are intended for scratch/temporary storage, and are subject to the same policies as local scratch/tmp directories, discussed above.\\nNetwork-attached local scratch storage is not backed up or archived by UMIACS.\\n\\nUNIX Local Storage Commands\\nBelow are a few different CLI commands that may prove useful for monitoring your local storage usage and performance. For additional information, run [command] --help or man [command]\\ndf - Shows descriptive file system information\\n\\nUsage: df [OPTION]... [FILE]...\\nShow information about the file system on which each FILE resides,\\nor all file systems by default.\\n\\ndu - Shows disk usage of specific files. Use the -d flag for better depth control.\\n\\nUsage: du [OPTION]... [FILE]...\\n  or:  du [OPTION]... --files0-from=F\\nSummarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.\\n\\nfree - Shows current memory(RAM) usage. Use the -h flag for a human readable format.\\n\\nUsage:\\n free [options]\\n\\nquota - Shows quota information, this is useful for viewing per filesystem limits in places such as a home directory. \\n\\nquota: Usage: quota [-guqvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat]\\n\\tquota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -u username ...\\n\\tquota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -g groupname ...\\n\\tquota [-qvswugQm] [-F quotaformat] -f filesystem ...\\n\\niostat - Shows drive utilization, as well as other utilizations.

So in the above example, I\\'d subscribe USER@umiacs.umd.edu and USER@umd.edu, but I would disable delivery to USER@umd.edu.\\nYou can disable delivery to an address by going to the personal options page for that address and setting \"Mail delivery\" to \"disabled\". \\nThe list manager can disable delivery to an address by going to the membership page and clicking \"no mail\" next to the address in question.\\n\\nHow do I change a member\\'s password or send them their password?\\nGo to the Membership Management page, click the address in question. The page that appears allows you to set a user\\'s password or mail them their existing password by clicking on \\n\\n  \"Email my password to me\"\\n\\nNote all the other options you can set for the user here.\\nDon\\'t forget that members can have their password sent to them anytime they like by clicking the appropriate button on their personal page. There is no need for you to change their password if they forget their password.

Go to the Membership Management page, and use the Additional Member Tasks to turn on the mod flag for all users.\\nThen go to Privacy Options -> Sender filters and set the default_member_moderation flag to Yes so that new users are automatically set as moderated.\\nSet the member_moderation_action to Reject and add a nice rejection notice text to the following text box.  \\n\\n  Set the generic_nonmember_action to Reject or Discard.\\n\\nHow do I unsubscribe users without them getting an unsubscribe message?\\nBy default, they will not get an unsubscribe message. You need only go to the membership page and click the \"unsub\" button next to each of their names and press \"submit\" or go to the Mass Removal subpage under Membership Management and add all the addresses into the  window and click \"submit\".\\n\\nHow do I edit a held message before approving it for the list?\\nUse the \"forward this message\" feature in the admindb page to forward the message to yourself.\\nAt the same time, discard the original held message. You may want to do this later, after you\\'re sure the message was properly forwarded to you.\\nEdit the message in your mail reader. You should include a notice in the message explaining that the list moderator has edited the message. Please use proper netiquette!\\nResend the message to the list using a Resent-To: header containing the list posting address. Also include an Approved: header containing the list\\'s admin password.\\n\\n\\nWhy don\\'t some messages get to the list?\\nSome lists may have spam filters turned on by staff to eliminate problems.\\nThese filters are under \"Privacy options...\" -> \"Spam filters\".\\nThe most common of these that will be applied is to restrict posts with [QUAR] in the subject.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MailmanFAQ&oldid=11375\"',\n",

You\\'ll need this password to do various list management things such as add/remove users, approve user subscription or postings for restricted lists, and tailor the list.\\nIf staff was provided with a list of initial subscribers, these people will have already been subscribed. Tell your users that if they\\'d like to subscribe, they need only go to\\n\\n http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME\\n\\neven if the list is private (not advertised or listed).\\nThey can also subscribe/unsubscribe by email by sending to\\n\\n LISTNAME-subscribe and LISTNAME-unsubscribe\\n\\nrespectively. In ALL of the above cases, the user will receive email confirming their action. They need to just reply to the mail for this to take effect.\\n\\nManaging a List\\nTo manage your list, go to:\\n\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME\\n\\nYou will be prompted for the aforementioned password. In general, most of the default settings are likely to be fine but you should know about the following capabilities and pieces of information.\\n\\nJust because you are the list administrator doesn\\'t mean you\\'re subscribed to (or you have to be subscribed to) this list.\\nMessages sent out aren\\'t necessarily delivered immediately; it could take up to 5 minutes.\\n\\n\\nMembership Management\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/members\\n\\nThis is where you can subscribe and unsubscribe users, hide their email addresses, and more.\\n\\nTo subscribe other people, on this form, enter their addresses in the text window under the \"Mass Subscription\" section. Please note that if the user you are adding has a UMD address, you should use that address in order to comply with the Institutional email standard.\\nIf a user goes on vacation, you can change the option to \"nomail\" for them on this form turning off mailing to that individual until he/she returns. Of course, users can do this themselves as well.\\nIf a user forgets their password, clicking on the user\\'s email address on this form allows you to send them an email message containing their password.\\n\\n\\nPrivacy options\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/privacy\\n\\nThis is where you can specify whether or not the list is visible to the world, whether or not administrative approval is required to subscribe to the list, who can view the list of subscribers, who can post to the list (is it open or moderated?), and more.\\n\\nArchiving Options\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/archive\\n\\nThis is where you can choose whether or not to archive messages send to the list. By default, messages are archived and are available only to subscribers of the list using their subscribing password at  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/private/LISTNAME. You can change this to make messages available to the public or turn off archiving entirely. Archives are not searchable.\\n\\nGeneral Settings\\nMost of the defaults for lists are probably fine but a number of them bear special mention. \\nOptions under Subscribing under \"Privacy options\":\\n\\nBy default, no one can see the list.\\nIf this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the first item \"Advertise this list when people ask what lists are on this machine?\" from NO to YES, and then \"Submit Your Changes\" on the bottom of the page. Note that even if users can\\'t see the list, they can still subscribe (or try to subscribe). They simply need to know the URL.\\n\\n\\nBy default, anyone can subscribe to the list. (To ensure that someone can\\'t subscribe someone else as a prank, Mailman sends a confirm email message to the users asking something like, \"You have been subscribed to.... Are you sure you want to subscribe? Just REPLYing to this message will subscribe you\").\\nIf this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the second item \"What steps are required for subscription?\" and click \"Require approval\" or \"Confirm and approve\" and then \"Submit Your Changes\" on the bottom of the page. Approval means that you, as the list administrator, will get a message saying USER@HOST wants to subscribe. You can then approve or discard their request.\\n\\n\\nOption under Membership exposure under \"Privacy options\":\\n\\nBy default, only list members can see the email addresses of other list members. Users can hide their own addresses from their list subscription page. Likewise, you can hide some users and not others from the \"Membership Management\" page.\\nIf you want to broadly change visibility for all users, change the setting on the first item \"Who can view subscription list?\" and click either \"Anyone\" or \"List admin only\" and then \"Submit Your Changes\" on the bottom of the page.\\n\\n\\nModerated Lists\\nSetup\\nIf you want your list to be moderated (i.e. ONLY you and/or a few others can post to it), this can be set at the bottom of the \"Membership Management\" --> \"Membership List\" page. Make sure to also set this for all new members under \"Privacy options\" --> \"Sender filters\". If moderation is set, make sure the list admin (and/or whomever you want to be able to send to the list) has their moderation bit turned off.\\nList admins can add moderators to a list by entering their email addresses in the \"The list moderator email addresses. Multiple moderator addresses, each on separate line is okay.\" box on the \"General Options\" page of the list\\'s admin interface:\\n\\n\\nAs soon as the first moderator is added to the list, a list admin should set the moderator password and communicate it to the initial moderator(s). This password can only be changed by a list admin. It does not give full administrative access to the list.\\n\\nFor list moderators\\nModerators and administrators will receive an email similar to the following if a message is being held for moderation:\\n\\n\\nThe provided URL can also be visited at any time to view the queue of messages pending moderation:\\n\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admindb/LISTNAME\\n\\nFrom here, if there are one or more messages pending moderation, you will see a summary of the messages broken down per-sender. Please note that the addresses in these screenshots are hidden for privacy, but will appear on the actual moderation page.\\nThere are two ways messages from senders may appear on this interface, depending on whether or not the sender is a member of the list:\\n\\nIf the sender is a member of the list (but their moderation bit is on):\\n\\nIf the sender is not a member of the list:\\n\\nFrom these windows, you can choose an action (Defer, Accept, Reject, Discard) for all messages from a specific sender via the radio buttons in the left sub-window, or handle individual messages by clicking on the [#] hyperlinks next to each subject line.\\nThe key difference between the two categories of held messages (from a moderated member vs. from a non-member) is how you can handle future messages from the respective senders in the future:\\n\\nFor moderated members, you can choose the \"Clear this member\\'s moderate flag\" option in the window for that member to automatically allow future messages from them to the list.\\nFor non-members, you can choose to either add the sender\\'s email address to one of the automatic filters for non-members (Accept, Hold, Reject, or Discard) to automatically action their messages in the future. There is also an option to ban the sender\\'s email address from subscribing to the list if you see fit.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MailmanListAdmin&oldid=8927\"',\n",

However, depending on the malware that we believe your machine to have been infected with, it is possible that private information may have been collected by a third party over the course of the infection and could still be used to cause further harm to your work or you personally. The longer the malware had time to propagate, the greater the risk is that this is the case. If you are being directed to this page, it is likely the case that we have determined that you are at risk and we highly recommend you change all passwords for applications and websites you have visited while the machine you used was infected with the malware. In addition, if you made any online purchases whilst using an infected machine please be sure to keep a close eye on your credit card transactions for the next several weeks after the machine has been cleansed.\\nBelow are a collection of links for changing passwords on commonly-used websites:\\n\\nUMIACS\\nUMD\\nGoogle / Gmail\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n\\nLastly, please be sure to pay attention to the behavior of the previously infected machine whilst using it.

This page lists and describes some of them. \\n\\nNote: these are just a few of the many available anti-virus removal tools. One can always search the internet for a well-reputed anti-virus program and use that instead.\\n\\nOnline vs Offline Scanners\\nThere are two types of malware/virus removal tools, online and offline. The main difference between the two is that offline scans work outside of your computer\\'s operating system. This can provide an alternate means for detecting and mitigating threats that may use various tactics to hide from your installed antivirus. On the other hand, online scanners can detect most problems while also being easier to use. Most online scanners have better interfaces than their offline counterparts, and they are usually easier to set up and run. Thus, the best way to remove malware or a virus would be to first try an online scanner and see if the issue still persists. If the online scanner did not fix the problem, then you should try an offline scanner. Below are some links to various online and offline scanners.\\n\\nOnline Scanners\\nF-Secure Online Scan\\nThe online scanner helps to get rid of viruses and spyware that may cause problems on your PC.\\n\\n\\nMalwarebytes\\nThis free version is limited, but can also perform malware and virus scans.\\n\\n\\nOffline/Bootable Scanners\\nMicrosoft Defender Offline\\nThis offline scan only works with machines using Windows 10 or 11.\\n\\n\\nUMIACS-Supported Machines\\nAll UMIACS-supported machines have F-Secure Client Security installed. Follow the steps below to run a manual scan using F-Secure on a UMIACS-supported machine.\\n\\nHow to a run manual F-Secure Scan\\n\\n Open F-Secure Client Security by searching it in the search bar.\\n\\n\\n This should open the F-Secure menu in a popup window in the bottom right of your desktop. If it doesn\\'t, try clicking the up arrow in the bottom right and selecting the F-Secure icon. Note that this screen will always say that your computer is not fully protected. This is because we do not run the Browsing Protection optional feature of the F-Secure suite, as it can cause website accessibility issues. If you click on the More Details link and the checkboxes other than the one that says Turn on Browsing Protection are all green, F-Secure is operating normally.\\n\\n \\n Click on the Manual scanning option in the bottom left side of the window (magnifying glass with a bug in it icon). This will show you your options for manual scanning.\\n\\n \\n Choose either Malware scan or Full computer scan.\\nMalware scan: Searches common places where malware can be found. This makes it faster, but it may miss some hidden malware.\\nFull computer Scan: Scans all internal/external hard drives for malware. This makes it more thorough than the malware scan, but it can take a long time to complete.\\n\\n\\n After choosing an option, another screen should pop up that shows the progress of the scan. \\n\\n \\n Once the scan is complete, it will provide a report stating whether any malware was found. If if did find malware, then it will show you the number of files it removed. You can click View scanning report to see more details about specific files.\\n\\n \\n Click the Close button to close the scan window and complete the scan.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Malware/virus_removal&oldid=10834\"',\n",

The only time this will need to be done is if Office is installed on a host that goes an extended length of time (180 days or more) without connecting to the campus network (either physically or through a VPN) and needs to be activated in a hurry.\\n\\nHow to Activate Office\\nPlease note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN, or the  UMIACS VPN to activate. The below steps will assume you have already established a network connection. Please also note that your time must be correct (i.e. set via the Internet) and set to the US Eastern timezone for this to work. You can try running w32tm /resync on the command line below in step 4 before running the other commands listed in that step and subsequent ones to resync your time if the commands fail at first.\\nOnce you are on the campus network follow these instructions:\\n\\nSimple Activation Method\\nOpen any Office product (Word, PowerPoint, etc.). This should automatically activate Office. If it fails to activate, follow the instructions below:\\n\\nCommand Line Activation Method\\nPlease note that your time must be correct for this to work, make sure you are in the East Coast timezone and your time is set via the internet, try running \"w32tm /resync\" on the command line.\\n\\nSearch for Command Prompt in the Start menu, right click it, and choose \"Run as administrator\".\\n\\nRun the following command to determine the bitness of your operating system.

They provide a way to add and remove environmental variables that provide access to UMIACS\\' large set of software that we offer on our  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Ubuntu platforms.  They work by customizing your shell environment which is done automatically for the two major shell families (bash/sh (default shell) and tcsh/csh).  If you use an alternate shell, please look to source the appropriate script for your shell in /usr/share/Modules/init.\\nInitially your module environment is empty, though included in your module path are local operating system specific modules, locally built software modules, and binary software modules (Matlab, Intel Compiler, etc.).\\n\\nAvailable Software\\nTo see if a piece of software is available, use the module avail command.

In order to use modules in a shell opened from a desktop session, you must source the modules init script. See #Modules in Non-Interactive Shell Sessions for the required commands. For convenience, we recommend adding this to the top of your shell init file (e.g ~/.bashrc, ~/.tcshrc), this way it gets sourced automatically with each new shell.\\nNote that this issue does not affect RHEL9 SSH sessions, only sessions using the desktop GUI.\\n\\nAdditional Help\\nYou can type module with no arguments for a full list of commands or man module for further information.\\n\\nOnline Resources\\nProject Page (SourceForge)\\nIntroduction to Modules\\nModules FAQ\\nuser-setup\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Modules&oldid=12125\"',\n",

       " 'MonthlyMaintenanceWindow\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\n UMIACS staff takes a monthly maintenance window to patch and reboot all UMIACS-supported hosts and services.  This provides a way to ensure security updates are installed and activated on the numerous different platforms and appliances that we maintain.\\nThe window for each month is calculated by adding 9 days to Microsoft\\'s Patch Tuesday to allow us to marshal patches released that month from Microsoft, Red Hat, Apple, and other OS and application vendors and have enough time to get our systems prepared to reboot.  This translates to the window being on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month.  The window lasts from 5pm-8pm.\\nNexus will always have a reservation in place from 4:45pm-8pm on the day of the upcoming window to prevent jobs from being scheduled on compute nodes for the entirety of said window as well as 15 minutes before, to allow jobs to fully end. Any job submitted before the reservation begins that has a time limit that would run into the reservation will be held until at least the end of the reservation (8pm on the day of the window). This is to prevent issues with jobs failing to end properly causing delays in work we have scheduled during the window.\\nA list of upcoming maintenance windows is as follows, with the next one in bold.

If your machine happens to have a manually set IP address that conflicts with that of another host, networking issues may arise.\\n\\n\\nAre you behind a firewall?\\nSome establishments use firewalls to restrict certain types of traffic both in and out of their networks.  If you are having trouble accessing a specific service, this might be the case.  To get around this you can connect to the VPN, or use SSH tunneling.\\n\\n\\nOther useful commands:\\ndig: performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried\\nhost: simple utility for performing DNS lookups\\nnetstat (macOS/Linux/UNIX): shows network status\\nroute print (Windows): shows network routing tables\\n\\n\\nChange your default DNS server\\nPlease see  DNS troubleshooting to change your default DNS server.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Network/Troubleshooting&oldid=11254\"',\n",

       " 'Nexus\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nThe Nexus is the combined scheduler of resources in UMIACS.  The resource manager for Nexus is SLURM.  Resources are arranged into partitions where users are able to schedule computational jobs.  Users are arranged into a number of SLURM accounts based on faculty, lab, or center investments.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Getting Started\\n\\n1.1 Access\\n1.2 Jobs\\n\\n1.2.1 Interactive\\n1.2.2 Batch\\n\\n2 Partitions\\n3 Quality of Service (QoS)\\n\\n3.1 Job QoS\\n3.2 Partition QoS\\n\\n\\n4 Storage\\n\\n4.1 Home Directories\\n4.2 Scratch Directories\\n\\n4.2.1 Network Scratch Directories\\n4.2.2 Local Scratch Directories\\n\\n\\n4.3 Faculty Allocations\\n4.4 Project Allocations\\n4.5 Datasets\\n\\nGetting Started\\nAll accounts in UMIACS are sponsored.  If you don\\'t already have a UMIACS account, please see Accounts for information on getting one.  You need a full UMIACS account (not a  collaborator account) in order to access Nexus.\\n\\nAccess\\nYour access to submission nodes (alternatively called login nodes) for Nexus computational resources is determined by your account sponsor\\'s department, center, or lab affiliation.  You can log into the UMIACS Directory CR application and select the Computational Resource (CR) in the list that has the prefix nexus.  The Hosts section lists your available submission nodes - generally a pair of nodes of the format nexus<department, lab, or center abbreviation>[00,01], e.g., nexusgroup00 and nexusgroup01.\\nNote - UMIACS requires multi-factor authentication through our Duo instance.  This is completely discrete from both UMD\\'s and CSD\\'s Duo instances.  You will need to enroll one or more devices to access resources in UMIACS, and will be prompted to enroll when you log into the Directory application for the first time.\\nOnce you have identified your submission nodes, you can SSH directly into them.  From there, you are able to submit to the cluster via our SLURM workload manager.  You need to make sure that your submitted jobs have the correct account, partition, and qos.\\n\\nJobs\\nSLURM jobs are  submitted by either srun or sbatch depending if you are doing an interactive job or batch job, respectively.  You need to provide the where/how/who to run the job and specify the resources you need to run with.\\nFor the who/where/how, you may be required to specify --account, --partition, and/or --qos (respectively) to be able to adequately submit jobs to the Nexus.\\nFor resources, you may need to specify --time for time, --ntasks for CPUs, --mem for RAM, and --gres=gpu for GPUs in your submission arguments to meet your requirements.  There are defaults for all four, so if you don\\'t specify something, you may be scheduled with a very minimal set of time and resources (e.g., by default, NO GPUs are included if you do not specify --gres=gpu).  For more information about submission flags for GPU resources, see  here.  You can also can run man srun on your submission node for a complete list of available submission arguments.\\nFor a list of available GPU types on Nexus and their specs, please see Nexus/GPUs.\\n\\nInteractive\\nOnce logged into a submission node, you can run simple interactive jobs.  If your session is interrupted from the submission node, the job will be killed.  As such, we encourage use of a terminal multiplexer such as Tmux.\\n\\n$ srun --pty --ntasks=4 --mem=2gb --gres=gpu:1 nvidia-smi -L\\nGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-ae5dc1f5-c266-5b9f-58d5-7976e62b3ca1)\\n\\nBatch\\nBatch jobs are scheduled with a script file with an optional ability to embed job scheduling parameters via variables that are defined by #SBATCH lines at the top of the file.  You can find some examples in our SLURM/JobSubmission documentation.\\n\\nPartitions\\nThe SLURM resource manager uses partitions to act as job queues which can restrict size, time and user limits.  The Nexus has a number of different partitions of resources.  Different Centers, Labs, and Faculty are able to invest in computational resources that are restricted to approved users through these partitions.\\nPartitions usable by all non-class account users:\\n\\nNexus/Tron - Pool of resources available to all UMIACS and CSD faculty and graduate students.\\nScavenger - Preemption partition that supports nodes from multiple other partitions.  More resources are available to schedule simultaneously than in other partitions, however jobs are subject to preemption rules.  You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.  The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again. For an overview of things you can check within scripts to determine if your job was preempted/resumed, see SLURM/Preemption. Only contains x86_64 architecture nodes.\\nScavenger (aarch64) - Preemption partition identical in design to scavenger, but only contains aarch64 architecture nodes.\\n\\n\\nPartitions usable by ClassAccounts:\\n\\n Class - Pool available for UMIACS class accounts sponsored by either UMIACS or CSD faculty.\\n\\n\\nPartitions usable by specific lab/center users:\\n\\nNexus/CBCB - CBCB lab pool available for CBCB lab members.\\nNexus/CLIP - CLIP lab pool available for CLIP lab members.\\nNexus/CML - CML lab pool available for CML lab members.\\nNexus/GAMMA - GAMMA lab pool available for GAMMA lab members.\\nNexus/MBRC - MBRC lab pool available for MBRC lab members.\\nNexus/MC2 - MC2 lab pool available for MC2 lab members.\\nNexus/Vulcan - Vulcan lab pool available for Vulcan lab members.\\n\\n\\nQuality of Service (QoS)\\nSLURM uses Quality of Service (QoS) both to provide limits on job sizes (termed by us as \"job QoS\") as well as to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user or per group (termed by us as \"partition QoS\").\\n\\nJob QoS\\nJob QoS are used to provide limits on the size of job that you can run. You should try to allocate only the resources your job actually needs, as resources that each of your jobs schedules are counted against your  fair-share priority in the future.\\n\\ndefault - Default job QoS. Limited to 4 CPU cores, 1 GPU, and 32GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 3 days.\\nmedium - Limited to 8 CPU cores, 2 GPUs, and 64GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 2 days.\\nhigh - Limited to 16 CPU cores, 4 GPUs, and 128GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 1 day.\\nscavenger - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is paired 1-1 with the scavenger partition. To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.  Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.\\nscavenger-aarch64 - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  1600 total CPU cores and 281140MB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is paired 1-1 with the scavenger-aarch64 partition. To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger-aarch64, --account=scavenger, and --qos=scavenger-aarch64 in your submission arguments.\\n\\n\\nYou can display these job QoS from the command line using the show_qos command.  By default, the command will only show job QoS that you can access.

Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.\\nFor example, in the default non-preemption partition (tron), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition.\\nLab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two \"TRES\" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition.\\nAll partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill issues with the SLURM scheduler.\\n\\nIf you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an \"outer submission script\" that repeatedly attempts to run an \"inner submission script\" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval.\\n\\n\\nAn example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an  array job, and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less.\\n\\n\\n#!/bin/bash\\nnumjobs=1000\\ni=0\\nwhile [ $i -lt $numjobs ]\\ndo\\n  while [[ \"$(sbatch example_inner.sh 2>&1)\" =~ \"QOSMaxSubmitJobPerUserLimit\" ]]\\n  do\\n    echo \"Currently at maximum job submissions allowed.\"\\n    echo \"Waiting for 5 minutes before trying to submit more jobs.\"\\n    sleep 300\\n  done\\n  i=$(( $i + 1 ))\\n  echo \"Submitted job $i of $numjobs\"\\ndone\\n\\nIt is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.\\n\\nStorage\\nAll network storage available in Nexus is currently NFS based, and comes in a few different flavors. Compute nodes also have local storage that can be used.\\n\\nHome Directories\\nYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.\\nHome directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.\\nNOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.\\n\\nScratch Directories\\nScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Nexus compute infrastructure:\\n\\nNetwork scratch directories\\nLocal scratch directories\\n\\n\\nPlease note that  class accounts do not have network scratch directories.\\n\\nNetwork Scratch Directories\\nYou are allocated 200GB of scratch space via NFS from /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME> where <USERNAME> is your UMIACS username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is  automounted; you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access it.\\nYou can view your quota usage by running df -h /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>.\\nYou may request a permanent increase of up to 400GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 400GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a  project allocation for this. If you choose to increase your scratch space beyond 400GB, the increased space is also subject to the 270 TB days limit mentioned in the project allocation section before we check back in for renewal. For example, if you request 1.4TB total space, you may have this for 270 days (1TB beyond the 400GB permanent increase). The amount increased beyond 400GB will also count against your faculty member\\'s 20TB total storage limit mentioned below.\\nThis file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.\\n\\nLocal Scratch Directories\\nEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on also has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc. and are not backed up or protected in any way.  These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job as they are mounted from disks directly attached to the compute node.  However, you must stage your data within the confines of your job and extract the relevant resultant data elsewhere before the end of your job.\\nThese local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our  monthly maintenance windows.  Please make sure you secure any resultant data you wish to keep from these directories at the end of your job.\\n\\nFaculty Allocations\\nEach faculty member can be allocated 1TB of permanent lab space upon request.  We can also support grouping these individual allocations together into larger center, lab, or research group allocations if desired by the faculty.  Please  contact staff to inquire.\\nLab space storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.\\n\\nProject Allocations\\nProject allocations are available per user for 270 TB days; you can have a 1TB allocation for up to 270 days, a 3TB allocation for 90 days, etc..\\nA single faculty member can not have more than 20TB of project allocations across all of their sponsored accounts active simultaneously. Network scratch allocation space increases beyond the 400GB permanent maximum also have the increase count against this limit (i.e., a 1TB network scratch allocation would have 600GB counted towards this limit).\\nProject storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.\\nThe maximum allocation length you can request is 540 days (500GB space) and the maximum storage space you can request is 9TB (30 day length).\\nTo request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:\\n\\nProject Name (short)\\nDescription\\nSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)\\nLength in days (270 days, 135 days, etc.)\\nOther user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any\\n\\n\\nThese allocations are available via /fs/nexus-projects/<project name>.  Renewal is not guaranteed to be available due to limits on the amount of total storage.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you are still in need of the storage allocation.  If renewal is available, you can renew for up to another 270 TB days with reapproval from the original faculty approver.\\n\\nIf you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.\\nIf you do not respond to staff\\'s request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.\\n\\n\\nDatasets\\nWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/nexus-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.\\nThe list of Nexus datasets we currently host can be viewed here.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus&oldid=12153\"',\n",

However, please note that cml- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone CML cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named cml in the standalone cluster (it is also named just cml in Nexus).\\nHere are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:\\n\\nStandalone CML cluster submission command\\n\\nNexus cluster submission command\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=cml-dpart --qos=cml-medium --account=cml-tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=cml-cpu --qos=cml-cpu --account=cml --pty bash\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=cml-scavenger --qos=cml-scavenger --account=cml-scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash\\n\\nCML users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on CML nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the cml-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all cml## nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named cml.\\nPlease note that the CML compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. CML users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the cml-scavenger partition (i.e., all cml- partition jobs (other than cml-scavenger) can preempt both cml-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and cml-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).\\n\\nPartitions\\nThere are three partitions available to general CML SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.\\n\\ncml-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\ncml-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other cml- partitions are ready to be scheduled.\\ncml-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nThere are two additional partitions available solely to specific faculty members and their sponsored accounts.\\n\\ncml-furongh - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Furong Huang\\'s purchased A6000 node. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\ncml-zhou - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Tianyi Zhou\\'s purchased nodes. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nAccounts\\nThe Center has a base SLURM account cml which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in the cluster have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster, which provides a number of guaranteed billing resources corresponding to the amount that they invested.\\nIf you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the cml account, which only has access to the cml-cpu, cml-default, and cml-medium QoSes (see below section).\\nIf you need access to a different QoS, or if the cml account is at its billing limit (see below in this section), please use your faculty sponsor\\'s account if they have one available. However, keep in mind that if you use your faculty sponsor has their own named partition (see previous section), using the faculty-specific account in the cml-dpart partition may block access to resources in the faculty-specific partition, since the billing limit for the account is charged regardless of what partition is being used.\\nThe current faculty accounts are:\\n\\ncml-abhinav\\ncml-cameron\\ncml-furongh\\ncml-hajiagha\\ncml-john\\ncml-ramani\\ncml-sfeizi\\ncml-tokekar\\ncml-tomg\\ncml-zhou\\n\\n\\n$ sacctmgr show account format=account%20,description%30,organization%10\\n             Account                          Descr        Org\\n-------------------- ------------------------------ ----------\\n                 ...                            ...        ...\\n                 cml                            cml        cml\\n         cml-abhinav      cml - abhinav shrivastava        cml\\n         cml-cameron            cml - maria cameron        cml\\n         cml-furongh             cml - furong huang        cml\\n        cml-hajiagha      cml - mohammad hajiaghayi        cml\\n            cml-john           cml - john dickerson        cml\\n          cml-ramani        cml - ramani duraiswami        cml\\n       cml-scavenger                cml - scavenger        cml\\n          cml-sfeizi             cml - soheil feizi        cml\\n         cml-tokekar           cml - pratap tokekar        cml\\n            cml-tomg            cml - tom goldstein        cml\\n            cml-zhou              cml - tianyi zhou        cml\\n                 ...                            ...        ...\\n\\nFaculty can manage this list of users via our Directory application in the Security Groups section.

It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.\\nHome directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.\\nNOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.\\n\\nProject Directories\\nYou can request project based allocations for up to 6TB for up to 120 days with one or more approvals:\\n\\nAllocations up to and including 3TB require approval from a CML faculty member\\nAllocations above 3TB (up to 6TB) require approval from both a CML faculty member and the director of CML\\n\\n\\nTo request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:\\n\\nProject Name (short)\\nDescription\\nSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)\\nLength in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)\\nOther user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any\\n\\n\\nThese allocations will be available from /fs/cml-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 120 days (requires re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML).  \\n\\nIf you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.\\nIf you do not respond to staff\\'s request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.\\n\\n\\nThis data is backed up nightly.\\n\\nScratch Directories\\nScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up.

It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.\\nYou may request a permanent increase of up to 800GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 800GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory. Space increases beyond 800GB also have a maximum request period of 120 days (as with project directories), after which they will need to be renewed with re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML.\\n\\nAs with project directories, allocations over 3TB total space require approval from the director of CML in addition to your faculty member.\\n\\n\\nThis file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.\\n\\nLocal Scratch Directories\\nEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.\\nThese local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.\\n\\nDatasets\\nWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/cml-datasets.

However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus.

Please note that the vulcan-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all vulcan## in aggregate nodes plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan.\\nPlease note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).\\n\\nNodes\\nThere are currently 46  GPU nodes available running a mixture of NVIDIA RTX A6000, NVIDIA RTX A5000, NVIDIA RTX A4000, NVIDIA Quadro P6000, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, and NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards. There are also 4 CPU-only nodes available.\\nAll nodes are scheduled with the SLURM resource manager.\\n\\nPartitions\\nThere are three partitions available to general Vulcan SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.\\n\\nvulcan-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed. Only nodes with GPUs from architectures before NVIDIA\\'s Ampere architecture are included in this partition.\\nvulcan-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other vulcan- partitions are ready to be scheduled.\\nvulcan-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nThere are a few additional partitions available to subsets of Vulcan users based on specific requirements.\\n\\nvulcan-ampere - This partition contains nodes with GPUs from NVIDIA\\'s Ampere architecture. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\nAs of Thursday 02/29/2024 at 12pm, there is a 4 hour time limit on interactive jobs in this partition. If you need to run longer jobs, you will need to modify your workflow into a job that can be submitted as a batch script.\\nAs of Thursday 03/21/2024 at 5pm, there is a limit of 4 CPUs and 48G memory maximum per GPU requested by a job. If you need to run jobs with more CPUs/memory, you will either need to request more GPUs in the job or use a different partition.\\n\\n\\nSubmission is restricted to the Slurm  accounts of the faculty who invested in these nodes:\\nAbhinav Shrivastava (vulcan-abhinav)\\nJia-Bin Huang (vulcan-jbhuang)\\nChristopher Metzler (vulcan-metzler)\\nMatthias Zwicker (vulcan-zwicker)\\n\\n\\nAccounts\\nVulcan has a base SLURM account vulcan which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in Vulcan compute infrastructure have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster.\\nIf you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the vulcan account.

Please also review UMIACS  Local Data Storage policies including any volume that is labeled as scratch.\\nVulcan users can also request  Nexus project allocations.\\n\\nHome Directories\\nYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.\\nHome directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.\\nNOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.\\n\\nScratch Directories\\nScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Vulcan compute infrastructure:\\n\\nNetwork scratch directory\\nLocal scratch directories\\n\\n\\nNetwork Scratch Directory\\nYou have 300GB of scratch storage available at /vulcanscratch/<username>.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.\\nYou may request a temporary increase of up to 500GB total space for a maximum of 120 days without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  Once the temporary increase period is over, you will be contacted and given a one-week window of opportunity to clean and secure your data before staff will forcibly remove data to get your space back under 300GB.  If you need space beyond 500GB or for longer than 120 days, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory.\\nThis file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.\\n\\nLocal Scratch Directories\\nEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage their data within the confine of their job and stage the data out before the end of their job.\\nThese local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month at 1am.  Different nodes will run the maintenance jobs on different days of the month to ensure the cluster is still highly available at all times.  Please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.\\n\\nDatasets\\nWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/vulcan-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.\\nThe list of Vulcan datasets we currently host can be viewed here.\\n\\nProject Storage\\nUsers within the Vulcan compute infrastructure can request project based allocations for up to 10TB for up to 180 days by  contacting staff with approval from the Vulcan faculty manager (Dr. Shrivastava).

       " 'OBJ\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nContents\\n\\n1 UMIACS Object Store\\n2 Terminology\\n3 Getting Started\\n4 Buckets\\n5 Keys (files)\\n6 Hosting a Website in your Bucket\\n7 Deleting Keys (files)\\n8 Clients\\n9 Access Key and Secret Key\\n10 LabGroups\\n11 Managing LabGroups\\n12 Requesting a LabGroup\\n\\n\\nUMIACS Object Store\\nAn object store is a web-based storage solution focused on reliability, scalability and security. It is best suited for public content storage/distribution, archiving data or secure data sharing between users. Our Object Store can be used through the web interface, the command line UMobj utilities, third-party graphical  clients, and even programmatically using many popular programming languages.  We support a subset of the Amazon Simple Storage Services (S3) API, built around a technology called Ceph.\\nAll data in our Object Store is stored on hard drives located in a datacenter managed by  UMIACS Staff.\\n\\nTerminology\\nS3-like storage thinks in terms of buckets and keys. Keys are analogous to files. A bucket is simply a container to a set of keys. There is no actual hierarchy inside of a bucket, but the standard UNIX path separator, a forward slash (/) at the end of a Key name, is interpreted by many clients (including this web site and our UMobj utilities) as being a directory delimiter. This allows you to copy data from your local filesystems to your buckets through umobj or third-party clients. You may specify who has what types of access to your buckets via Access Control Lists (ACLs) at the bucket level or the individual key level.\\nYour data is protected from individual machine failure via replication within the cluster. All data is checksummed in accordance with the Amazon S3 protocol to ensure that data in transit is valid before it is accepted by the cluster. However, there are no backups or snapshots of this data in the cluster, so if a user deletes a key or bucket in the Object Store, there is no way to restore that information.\\n\\nGetting Started\\nUMIACS users are allocated 50GB of storage.  Faculty are allocated 10TB. To get started, log in and you will be redirected to the initial help page.  You can also find the link from our https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu site as \"OBJbox Object Store\".\\n\\nBuckets\\nYou can create and browse your buckets (containers that hold data) by visiting your buckets page. You can also set bucket-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) from this page. Bucket-level ACLs get implicitly inherited to all the keys within the bucket. However, individual keys can have additional specific ACLs applied for more granular control.\\nBucket names must be unique. When you create a bucket it will notify you if the name is already taken.\\n\\nKeys (files)\\nAfter selecting a bucket, you will be able to create folders and upload files within that bucket. Listed files can be downloaded, deleted, or assigned a specific ACL by the key owner/creator.\\nPlease note: Local file system ownership and permissions, and special files (such as symlinks) can not be represented in the Object Store. We highly suggest that if you are securing data into the Object Store and need these to be faithfully maintained that you use a local archive tool (tar, zip, etc..) to collect the data and then upload the resulting archive file(s).\\n\\nHosting a Website in your Bucket\\nPlease visit OBJ/WebHosting for more information.\\n\\nDeleting Keys (files)\\nWithin the web interface you can delete files one-by-one. If you want to remove a bunch of files, you will need to use a different client as described below.\\nThis is dangerous as there are no backups of files in the Object Store. Be careful to only delete the data you intend to delete.\\n\\nClients\\nThere are several clients that can be used (sometimes with a limited set of features) on your desktop to gain access to the Object Store. All supported UMIACS systems running RHEL8 have a copy of our UMobj utilities preinstalled which provide command line access to the Object Store. We also have an article in our wiki on  third party clients that lists and explains the details. These clients need to be configured with your Access and Secret Keys as described below.\\n\\nAccess Key and Secret Key\\nEach user has one or more pairs of Access Keys and Secret Keys that are used as a credential to not expose your password when using the Object Store. These can be obtained by clicking on your username in the upper right-hand corner. You\\'ll use these to identify and authenticate yourself to the Object Store.\\nPlease treat your Secret Key(s) with the same confidentiality as a password and do not plaintext it over email or otherwise or share it with any other individuals.\\nWhen using the umobj utilities, you will need to make sure you have added these credentials in your local shell initialization files. There are links to files that have these automatically generated for the 3 most popular UNIX shell families (bash/sh, csh/tcsh, and zsh). Please make sure that whatever file(s) you copy these credentials into can not be read by other users (eg. chmod 600 filename).\\nNote: Each Access Key and Secret Key are specific to a particular object store, so if you are accessing multiple object stores you may want to write the credentials for each to separate files and then source each file when you want to use the associated object store. Please  contact staff if you have any questions.\\n\\nLabGroups\\nLabGroups allow a group of users to share data while avoiding the need for complex ACLs by maintaining group ownership. Designated LabGroup managers can grant granular access (read, write, full control, manager) to buckets owned by the LabGroup. All objects owned by a LabGroup count against the group quota. LabGroups can be navigated using the menu with username in the top right corner of the page. Note: this will only appear if you are a member of at least one LabGroup. At this point, you can browse the Object Store as the LabGroup and obtain your unique Access Key and Secret Key pair using the instructions above. To switch to another LabGroup or back to your own buckets, click the menu again and select another user or group.\\n\\nManaging LabGroups\\nLabGroups have many different levels of membership: Managers, FULL_CONTROL, READ/WRITE, and READ. Managers can add or remove LabGroup Members while every other access level cannot. If you hold the Manager role in a LabGroup, you can add and remove users using the Manage LabGroups page, which is available under the Manage menu at the top of the page. After selecting a LabGroup, you can add users by typing their username into the search field and selecting a membership role.\\n\\nRequesting a LabGroup\\nTo request a LabGroup for your project, please  contact staff.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=OBJ&oldid=12102\"',\n",
       " 'OBJ/WebHosting\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nUMIACS\\'  Object Store has the ability to host websites. On the settings page for each bucket, there is a section allowing you to specify a configuration for a website hosted in your bucket. You can choose keys located in your bucket to act as the index file (what will be displayed when someone visits your website) and the error file (what will be displayed when an error is encountered loading your website). These settings can be updated at any time.\\nBecause hosting a website through your bucket requires others to have access to any keys associated with your website, setting up a website configuration will automatically set the visibility of your bucket to public and remove the bucket level ACLs. You will not be able to set the bucket back to private without first removing the website configuration, which can be done on the bucket settings page.\\nNote: The Object Store only has the capability to support static content and client-side scripting in bucket websites.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Hosting a Website\\n2 Accessing the Website\\n3 Setting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage\\n4 Disabling a Website\\n5 Misc\\n\\n\\nHosting a Website\\nHosting a website in OBJ is quite easy and can be done in a few simple steps. There are three different ways you can set up your OBJ bucket to host a static website.\\nFirst Method (Using the Web Interface):\\n\\nLog into OBJ and create a bucket. Make sure to choose a bucket name carefully since this will be part of the web URL. \\n\\n\\nUpload your index.html file and optional error.html file (and any other required files for your website) on the bucket that you just created.\\nOnce the files are uploaded, click on Bucket Settings\\nOn the settings page, click on the blue Make Public button. \\n\\nUnder Website Hosting, enter the name of your index.html (and optionally error.html) file and hit Submit.\\n\\n\\nSecond Method (Using the UMobj CLI):\\n\\nSet up your environment variables.\\nOn the shell enter mkobj <bucket_name> to create a bucket. Your bucket name must be unique. You can enter lsobj -l to see the existing buckets.\\nCopy all the required files to the bucket: cpobj [source_directory]/file_name <bucket_name>:. For example, cpobj /fs/www-users/jayid-test/index.html jayid-test:\\nCreate a web configuration for your bucket:  webobj -m create -c website --index=index.html --error=error.html <bucket_name>\\nMake your bucket public: chobj -m public <bucket_name>\\n\\n\\nThird Method (Using a Graphical S3 Client):\\n\\nSince there are many different graphical clients available, we won\\'t be able to cover detailed instructions for all of them. The instruction below only applies to Cyberduck.\\n\\nPlease refer to S3Clients to download and install Cyberduck.\\nLog into Cyberduck using the instruction from the previous step.\\nOnce logged in, right-click > New Folder.... Give a unique name to your bucket.\\nRight-click on the bucket you just created, and click on Upload.... You can upload multiple files at once.\\nOnce all the files are uploaded, right-click on the same bucket, and click on info.\\nUnder the Distribution (CDN) tab make sure to leave a checkmark next to Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.\\n\\nNext, click on the drop-down menu next to Index File and select your index.html file (or whatever file you\\'re using as your index file).\\nUnder the Permission tab, add a permission by clicking on the cog icon on the bottom left and click on Everyone. Change the permission for Everyone to READ as shown on the image below.<\\n\\nAccessing the Website\\nYou can access the website by using the default URL which has the form https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io.\\n\\nSetting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage\\nIf you are intending to use the site as your personal UMIACS webpage, once the bucket is configured and all the required files are uploaded, please log into your UMIACS Directory page and update the Home Page attribute to https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io. Replace <Bucket_name> with the name of the bucket you created.\\nAfterwards, www.umiacs.umd.edu/~username will also redirect to your website.\\n\\nDisabling a Website\\nIf you no longer wish to host a website, you can disable the bucket\\'s web configuration.\\n\\nUsing the web interface:\\n\\nClick on the bucket where you are hosting your website and then click on Bucket Settings.\\nOn the settings page you can, click on Remove Website Configuration. Alternatively, you can also click on the Make Private button to make your bucket private and remove any associated web configuration.\\n\\n\\nUsing the CLI:\\n\\nEnter the following command in the terminal: webobj -m delete -c website <bucket_name>\\nUsing a Graphical S3 Client (Cyberduck):\\n\\n\\nRight-click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and click info.\\nClick on the Distribution (CDN) tab and uncheck the box Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.\\n\\n\\nMisc\\nMore commands for umobj\\nS3Clients\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=OBJ/WebHosting&oldid=10661\"',\n",

       " 'Phishing\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nPhishing attacks may be hard to distinguish from legitimate administrative messages, especially those in which the supposed UMIACS staff advise or require users to take administrative actions related to their account (e.g. storage quota, email account, or general account usage). \\nBelow are some helpful tips and practices that will make it easier to distinguish between legitimate UMIACS staff messages and phishing attempts.\\n\\nLegitimate Mail from Staff\\nThe UMIACS intranet site, intranet.umiacs.umd.edu will always have a posted announcement of any administrative actions we wish all UMIACS users to take collectively. We suggest manually typing this address into your browser or having a bookmark for this site. This URL should also always be SSL-secured. Please check that your browser is reporting a secure connection when visiting the site. This will always be the case for any URL in the *.umiacs.umd.edu domain.\\nWhen we do send out requests for advisory and mandatory actions for a user they will usually be signed with a staff member\\'s GPG key. We provide a tool called Verify Staff GPG Messages from the UMIACS intranet site (also linked below). This allows you to paste the text of the message and confirm that the sender is legitimate. Please note that other communications that are initiated by users through our Jira ticket system or in response to these tickets will not be signed.\\n\\nVerify Staff GPG Messages\\n\\n\\nSome Telltale Signs of Phishing\\nThe above steps should ensure that you are properly able to identify legitimate messages sent by staff. Below are some additional generic signs that should help identify phishing attempts.\\n\\nBogus to and from addresses (not within the UMIACS or UMD domains)\\nMessage not directly referencing you by name (e.g. \"Hello user\" or \"Hello researcher\")\\nSender of message demanding that action be taken immediately or consequences will occur (without an appropriate GPG key included)\\nPoor grammar and spelling in the message\\nHyperlinks pointing to different locations than they claim to or shady attachments being included with the message\\nWARNING: Do NOT click on any links or open any attachments in a message you suspect to be a phishing attempt, as these may lead to the execution of malicious programs on your machine. Instead, hover over links to check where they really point to.\\n\\n\\nIf you ever have questions about the legitimacy of a message, please contact the  Help Desk and we can verify whether or not it was sent out by staff.\\n\\nIf You Have Fallen Victim\\nIf you believe you\\'ve fallen victim to a phishing attack or otherwise believe your account may have been compromised, please contact the  Help Desk immediately. The sooner we know about any potential issues, the sooner we can take preventive measures to make sure as little harm is done as possible. This typically will involve a password change as well as possibly locking out access to your account for some period of time while we ensure your account is secure.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Phishing&oldid=11249\"',\n",
       " 'Podman\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nPodman is a daemonless container engine alternative to Docker.  We don\\'t support Docker in many of our environments as it grants trivial administrative control over the host the Docker daemon runs on.  Podman on the other hand has the ability to run containers in user namespaces.  This means that for every user name space in the kernel you create the processes within it will map to a new uid/gid range.  For example, if you are root in your container, you will not be uid 0 outside the container, but instead you will be uid 4294000000.\\nWe still believe that Apptainer is the best option for running containerized workloads on our clustered based resources.  Podman is a good option for developing the containers to be run via Apptainer or building a deliverable for a funding agency.  Please  contact staff if you would like Podman installed on a workstation or standalone server.  More information on Podman running rootless can be found here.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Getting Started\\n\\n1.1 Storage\\n\\n\\n2 GPUs\\n3 Example\\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nTo get started there are a few things that you need to configure.\\nFirst, run the podman command.  If it says command not found or you get an ERRO like the one below about no subuid ranges, and you are on a workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server, please  contact staff with the error and the host that you are using.  We will need to do some steps to setup the host you want ready.\\n\\n$ podman\\nERRO[0000] cannot find mappings for user username: No subuid ranges found for user \"username\" in /etc/subuid\\nError: missing command \\'podman COMMAND\\'\\nTry \\'podman --help\\' for more information.\\n\\nStorage\\nContainers are made up of layers for the image and these are stored in the graphroot setting of ~/.config/containers/storage.conf which by default will be in your home directory.  With our home directories being available over NFS there is an issue that due to the user name space mapping described above you will not be able to access your home directory when you are building the layers.\\nYou need to update the graphroot setting to a local directory on the host.  The file ~/.config/containers/storage.conf may not exist until you run podman the first time, however you can manually create it.\\n\\n[storage]\\n  driver = \"vfs\"\\n  graphroot = \"/scratch0/username/.local/share/containers/storage\"\\n...\\n\\nWhen building larger images, it may fill up the default directory for imageCopyTmpDir (/var/tmp). If this happens, you will need to specify a different directory using the environment variable TMPDIR. For example:\\n\\nexport TMPDIR=\"/scratch0/example_tmp_directory\"\\nGPUs\\nRunning Podman with the local Nvidia GPUs requires some additional configuration steps that staff has to add to any individual workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server that runs Podman.  This includes ensuring the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed.\\nFor example you can run nvidia-smi from within the official Nvidia CUDA containers with a command like this, optionally replacing the tag for different CUDA versions/OS images:\\n\\n$ podman run --rm --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8 nvidia-smi\\nThu Apr 16 18:47:04 2020\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     |\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

See Printing for more details specific to your OS.  We have developed a naming scheme for our printer queues based on the colors the printer can produce, the type of queue, the building number, and the room number.\\nThe naming scheme is as follows:\\n\\nAll color printers begin with a \"c\".  Black & white is the default so nothing extra is needed.\\nThen either \"ps\" for a PostScript-enabled queue or \"pcl\" for a Printer Command Language-enabled queue will appear.  PostScript and PCL are types of printer drivers.  If you are unsure what this means, use \"ps\" for PostScript.  PCL drivers may not always be available.\\nThen add the building number and a dash (\"-\"). E.g. add \"432-\" for IRB, \"115-\" for AVW, or \"224-\" for ATL.\\nThen add the room number. E.g. If the printer is in room 3208, add \"3208\".\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\nps432-3208 is a black & white printer in Iribe 3208.\\ncps224-3261 is a color printer in Atlantic 3261.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=PrinterQueueNaming&oldid=10783\"',\n",

This page offers best practices and guidelines for publishing your information using our resources. It also offers instructions for storing data that is within your allotted quota.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Best Practices\\n2 LabGroups\\n3 OBJ Usage\\n\\n3.1 Uploading files/data\\n3.2 Publishing Websites\\n\\nBest Practices\\nWhen publishing anything, the following items are important to consider:\\n\\nBe sure that any/all data is published via a faculty member\\'s account or a Labgroup (see below), not a student\\'s. This is especially important when the data in question is meant to be permanent. This will reduce the chance of any broken links once the student leaves and their UMIACS account is archived.\\nOBJ (see below) should be used whenever data or websites are published.\\nMake sure UMIACS is credited on any papers that contain UMIACS URLs.\\n\\n\\nLabGroups\\nLabGroups allow for multiple users to upload data to a central shared location. This is especially useful if multiple people are contributing to a single project. To learn more about LabGroups, visit The OBJ help page or OBJ for more information. \\n\\nOBJ Usage\\nThe use of the  UMIACS Object Storage (otherwise known as OBJ) is the preferred method of publishing websites, data, and related info. Below are some short guides to publish websites and/or data on OBJ.\\n\\nUploading files/data\\nAfter logging in to OBJ, select \"Add Bucket\".\\nA \"bucket\" is essentially a folder that stores files.\\n\\n\\nUpload any datasets or other files that contain the data you wish to publish.\\nFor publishing websites, continue to the \"Publishing Websites\" section. For datasets and the like continue on.\\nIn order to make any files publicly available, click the settings cog on the right side of the file, scroll down, and click \"Make Key Public\"\\nNote that this makes this specific file available to anyone with the link. If you only wish to grant temporary access or access to a specific user, you may want to consider creating a timed download link or modifying the Access Control List at the bottom of the page. More information can be found on the OBJ help page\\n\\n\\nPublishing Websites\\nGenerally, for publishing websites, you\\'ll want to upload all your website files under one bucket. UMIACS recommends that you include an index.html file as well as a error file to be shown in case of a broken link (404). Once all these files are uploaded:\\n\\nIn the bucket, click \"bucket settings\" at the top of the window.\\nUnder the \"Website Hosting\" section, put the name of your index file (usually just index.html) and the name of your 404 page.\\nClick \"Submit\".\\nKeep in mind that this will expose all data in your bucket. We recommend keeping any sensitive/access controlled data in a separate bucket.\\n\\n\\nThe website will be made public and can be reached using the link at the right side. In order to make the website non-public, simply click \"Remove Website Configuration\" and then \"Make Private\" in the above section.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the above, there are more ways to add data to OBJ which can prove useful, especially if working with a lot of files.

If the system version is not sufficient, there are multiple versions of Python available via  GNU Modules.  If you find that you need a version of Python that is not currently available through GNU Modules, you can always build it from source.\\nIf you are using Windows, you can install your required version of Python without Administrator credentials.  Please see the  Windows Python page.\\n\\nPython Environment\\nPython utilizes a variable called \\'PYTHONPATH\\', which is similar to the PATH variable used in many shells.  The PYTHONPATH variable tells the Python interpreter where to look to find modules.\\nTo view your python path:\\n\\nbash:~$ python -c \\'import sys; print sys.path\\'\\nYou can add directories to your PYTHONPATH either through your shell, or in your Python code itself:\\n\\nbash:~$ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/location/to/directory\\n\\n                 ...or...\\n\\n>>> sys.path.append(\\'/location/to/directory\\')\\nInstalling Modules\\nWhile some of the Versions of Python available in GNU modules provide a default set of modules pre-installed, you may wish to install your own.  Typically you will not have access to the global Python install location, so you will have to install modules using an alternative method.\\n\\nUnix/Linux Alternate Module Installation\\n\\'User\\' scheme\\nThe user scheme allows a user to install the module into the site userbase (python -c \\'import site; print site.USER_BASE\\').  This file location is included in the PYTHONPATH by default.\\n\\nbash:~$ python setup.py install --user\\n\\'Prefix\\' scheme\\nThe prefix scheme allows a user to install a module into a location of their choice.

Please note that the Use% here is for the entire file system and not your user-specific home directory.\\n\\n# df .\\nFilesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on\\ndata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/username\\n\\nThen run quota and that line will list your quota information for that file system.  If you see errors such as \"Error while getting quota from ...\" you may safely ignore these as some of our file systems do not report quotas correctly.\\n\\n$ quota\\nDisk quotas for user username (uid 13337):\\n     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace\\ndata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username\\n                     24  5138024 5242880              10  10276045 10485760\\n\\nIf you have hit your RPC quota and haven\\'t realized it, you may see some strange issues. For example, you will not be able to write-out files (although \\'touch\\' and file concatenation will succeed). Some applications such as vi will throw \"FSync\" errors. Similarly, commands such as wget will appear to succeed but your files will be zero-length.\\n\\nTree Quotas\\nAn alternate style of quota management is done through tree quotas that show up in how much space is available in the file system by using the df command to inspect either the current path (no arguments given) or a given path.\\nFor example to show my /nfshomes/username home directory quota, I can just use df ~\\n\\n$ df ~\\nFilesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on\\ndata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/username\\n\\nCalculating Space Usage\\nWhen you are looking to diagnose how much space you are using you often want to know how much storage the immediate directories are taking in a certain folder.  The utility to do this is du.  Since *NIX operating systems use the concept of .. for the previous directory simple file globs like .* don\\'t provide exactly what you need since in certain places like your home directories there are a lot of dot files or hidden files (eg. .somename).  To identify all files and directories from the current directory you can use something like du -hs .[^.]* *.\\n\\n-bash-4.2$ du -hs .[^.]* *\\n48K     .bash_history\\n94M     .cache\\n160K    .compiz\\n3.0M    .config\\n32K     .gconf\\n64K     .gnupg\\n48K     .history\\n48K     .ICEauthority\\n4.2M    .local\\n29M     .mozilla\\n224K    .ssh\\n48K     .viminfo\\n48K     .Xauthority\\n48K     .xsession-errors\\n7.2M    catkin_ws\\n32K     Desktop\\n32K     Documents\\n57M     Downloads\\n32K     Music\\n32K     perl5\\n32K     Pictures\\n32K     Public\\n32K     Templates\\n32K     Videos\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Quota&oldid=11465\"',\n",

       " 'Rclone\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nRclone is a command line program useful for syncing files and directories. Its functionality is similar to rsync, but has additional capabilities that support cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Open Drive, Amazon S3, and many more. \\nBelow are directions on how to remote setup rclone on a headless machine. If you would like to set up specific Google Drive or Dropbox remotes, you can go directly to the section labeled \"Google Drive\" or \"Dropbox\".\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Remote Setup on A Headless System\\n\\n1.1 Rclone configuration file\\n1.2 Rclone authorize\\n\\n\\n2 Google Drive\\n\\n2.1 Common Use\\n2.2 Creating a cronjob\\n\\n\\n3 Dropbox\\n\\n\\nRemote Setup on A Headless System\\nTo remote setup rclone, you will first have to SSH into one of UMIACS\\' hosts and load the rclone module by typing module load rclone. If this does not work, check that the rclone module is available by running the command module avail rclone. If the module is not available, SSH to a host where it is.\\nIf you are instead installing rclone on a system that you have administrative privileges on, downloads are available at https://rclone.org/downloads/.\\nOnce you have loaded the module or installed the software, there are two ways to remote configure rclone. The first is by copying the rclone config file, and the second is by using rclone authorize.\\n\\nRclone configuration file\\nTo copy the rclone config file, first configure rclone on your desktop machine. This can be achieved by running the command rclone config to set up the file and then finding the location of the configuration file using the command rclone config file, which should yield output similar to what is below:\\n\\n$ rclone config file\\nConfiguration file is stored at:\\n/home/user/.rclone.conf\\n\\nThis file can then be transferred to the remote box using scp, copy/paste, ftp, sftp, etc. The command rclone config file can also be run on the remote box to find the correct location to which the file should be moved.\\n\\nRclone authorize\\nTo configure using rclone authorize instead, run the command Remote config on your headless machine, and then select the option for working on a headless machine by answering the first prompt with an n. The resulting output should look like this:\\n\\nRemote config\\nUse auto config?\\n * Say Y if not sure\\n * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine\\ny) Yes\\nn) No\\ny/n> n\\n\\nFor this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.\\nExecute the following on your machine:\\n\\trclone authorize \"amazon cloud drive\"\\nThen paste the result below:\\nresult>\\n\\nNext, on your main desktop machine, run the command rclone authorize \"amazon cloud drive\". Follow the link that the output directs you to; you should now have received a secret token on your desktop machine console, in a message similar to the one below:\\n\\nrclone authorize \"amazon cloud drive\"\\nIf your browser doesn\\'t open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth\\nLog in and authorize rclone for access\\nWaiting for code...\\nGot code\\nPaste the following into your remote machine --->\\nSECRET_TOKEN\\n<---End paste\\n\\nGo back to your headless machine and paste the secret message on the console where it says result>. Finally, approve the token by answering the prompts that follow:\\n\\nresult> SECRET_TOKEN\\n--------------------\\n[acd12]\\nclient_id = \\nclient_secret = \\ntoken = SECRET_TOKEN\\n--------------------\\ny) Yes this is OK\\ne) Edit this remote\\nd) Delete this remote\\ny/e/d>\\n\\nIf there are any issues with the remote setup, visit https://rclone.org/remote_setup/ for more information.\\n\\nGoogle Drive\\nIn order to sync files to Google Drive on Linux systems, use of the command line program Rclone is necessary. The first step is to SSH into one of UMIACS\\' hosts with X11 forwarding enabled (use the -XY flag) or (if the host is a workstation) log in over GUI and launch the terminal. If Rclone is already in the module tree, then load the Rclone module using:\\n\\nmodule load rclone\\n\\nIf the module is NOT installed on the machine, install it from here: https://rclone.org/downloads/\\nOnce installed, load into it using the previous command.\\nTo make a new remote, run the command rclone config. This should produce output similar to what is below:\\n\\nn) New remote\\nr) Rename remote\\nc) Copy remote\\ns) Set configuration password\\nq) Quit config\\nn/r/c/s/q> \\n\\nChoose to make a new remote, and give it a name. There should then be prompt asking for the type of storage to configure. Input drive for Google Drive.\\n\\nType of storage to configure.\\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own value\\n 1 / 1Fichier\\n   \\\\ \"fichier\"\\n 2 / Alias for an existing remote\\n   \\\\ \"alias\"\\n ...\\n ...\\n37 / premiumize.me\\n   \\\\ \"premiumizeme\"\\n38 / seafile\\n   \\\\ \"seafile\"\\nStorage> drive\\n\\nWhen prompted for your Google Application Client Id and Secret, it is okay to leave those blank. Rclone will then prompt for a scope that it should use when requesting access from your drive, which you can provide by selecting one of the numbers on the screen. The suggested value for full operation is 1.\\n\\nGoogle Application Client Id\\nSetting your own is recommended.\\nSee https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id for how to create your own.\\nIf you leave this blank, it will use an internal key which is low performance.\\nEnter a string value.

To create a cronjob for an Rclone command, first you must find the path of Rclone. This can be done using the which command.\\n\\n[user@workstation ~]$ which rclone\\n/opt/common/rclone-v1.53.4-linux-amd64/rclone\\n\\nThen use crontab -e to edit your crontab. Once in the crontab, you can input your Rclone command using the command path found previously. An example of an Rclone cronjob that would occur every hour on the hour would be:\\n\\n0 * * * * /opt/common/rclone-v1.53.4-linux-amd64/rclone copy /<PATHTOBEBACKEDUP>/ <REMOTENAME>:<BACKUPNAME>\\n\\nDropbox\\nThese instructions assume that you have SSH\\'d into one of UMIACS\\' hosts and have successfully been able to load the rclone module using the command module load rclone, or installed rclone yourself on a system that you have administrative privileges on. If this is not the case, please do so before proceeding with the Dropbox remote setup.\\nFirst, make a new remote by running the command rclone config.

The setup will then prompt you to choose a type of storage to configure. You can either choose the number from the options that corresponds to \"Dropbox\", or simply type in dropbox. When prompted for your Dropbox App Key and Secret, it is okay to leave those blank. \\nThe console will then redirect you to a browser page that will prompt you to enter a code displayed on the console and authorize rclone for access. Once you have followed the instructions on the webpage, the console will display your credentials and ask for approval to confirm the remote.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Rclone&oldid=11684\"',\n",
       " 'Remote Desktop\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nContents\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n2 How to Connect\\n\\n2.1 Windows\\n2.2 macOS\\n2.3 UNIX\\n\\n\\n3 Redirecting Resources on Windows\\n\\n3.1 Audio Redirection\\n3.2 Other Resource Redirection\\n\\n\\n4 Redirecting Resources on Mac\\n\\n4.1 Folder/Drive Redirection\\n4.2 Other Resource Redirection\\n\\nIntroduction\\nRemote Desktop allows you to connect to another computer from a network that is compatible. Currently, at UMIACS, this feature is only supported for Windows hosts using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). If you need to remotely connect to a UNIX host, please see SecureShell. With RDP, you can control your Windows desktop environment through a graphical user interface. Mouse and keyboard movements are transferred over a network to a Windows host running an RDP server, which sends screen refreshes back. \\nTo access an RDP enabled machine, you must be on the UMIACS physical network or VPN. You must also be authorized to access and remotely control the host you are requesting. If a remote session is active, it is not possible for another user to log onto the console in-person. Attempting to use RDP when a computer is in use by another user could force the existing user to logoff and lose their work. You should always quit RDP by logging off of the remote computer. Simply quitting the RDP client can cause you to stay logged in and prevent other users from accessing the remote host, even at the physical console.\\n\\nHow to Connect\\nPrerequisites:\\nConnected to the  UMIACS VPN or be within the UMIACS network border.\\nBe a member of the \\'Remote Desktop Users\\' group on the remote machine. Please  contact staff if you do not have remote access to a machine you feel you should.\\n\\n\\nWindows\\nFor connecting to Windows client over RDP, we recommend the native Windows \\'Remote Desktop Connection\\' client. \\n\\nTo start the RDC client, click the \"Start\\'\" or \"Windows\" button on the taskbar. In the menu, navigate to \"All Programs,\" \"Accessories,\" then select \"Remote Desktop Connection\". Alternatively, you can search for \"Remote Desktop Connection\" in the Start menu\\'s search field.\\nOnce RDC client starts, type the name of the RDP/Windows host you are trying to access. The name should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN), e.g. desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu where desktop is replaced by the name of the desktop you are trying to connect to. At this point, click \"Connect\" to initiate the RDP session.\\n\\nUpon reaching the Windows Security prompt, enter your UMIACS credentials. Please note that the username must be in the format UMIACS\\\\username, where username is replaced by your UMIACS username. The slash must also be a back slash and not a forward slash. If the username is either not correct or not the desired account, click on \"More choices\" and select \"Use another account\". Click \"Ok\" when you are done.\\n\\nAfter the connection is started, a warning message may alert you to an identity verification failure. For UMIACS machines, you can ignore this and proceed by checking the box and selecting \"Yes\".\\n\\nYou should now be viewing the remote computer. To terminate the session, you should logout of Windows.\\n\\n\\nTo switch between your current host and the remote host, click the minimize or \"-\" button on the top connection bar. With RDC, the clipboard can be transferred between the remote and current host while the RDC client is running and logged in.\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the Microsoft Remote Desktop application from the Windows Store, which is available for download here.\\n\\nOpen Microsoft Remote Desktop.\\nClick \"Add\" in the top right corner.\\n\\nNext, click \"Desktop - Connect to a PC\".\\n\\nType the name of the RDP/Windows host you are trying to access in PC Name. The name should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN), e.g. \"desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu\". Once you have filled that out, click Save.\\n\\nNow, you should be on a page where you will see the PC you have just added. Double-click the PC and enter your UMIACS credentials. Please note that the username must be in the format UMIACS\\\\username (this must be a back slash and not a forward slash). Then, click Connect.\\n\\nIf it asks to \"Accept certificate and connect?\", press Connect.\\n\\n\\nmacOS\\nFor connecting to Windows client over RDP, we recommend the \\'Microsoft Remote Desktop\\' application. Another option, although less preferred, is the CoRD client.\\n\\nOpen the \\'Microsoft Remote Desktop Application\\' and select \\'+ New\\' to create a new device profile\\n\\nFill in the\\'PC Name\\' field with the name of the remote host you wish to connect to. If you wish to redirect resources from the remote machine to your local machine, please see the section titled \\'Redirecting Resources on Mac\\' below. Then press the blue add button in the bottom right corner.\\n\\nYou will now see the device listed below. Double click it to start the connection.\\n\\nYou will then be prompted for the username and password used to log into the remote host. After typing in both the username and password, press the blue continue button.\\n\\nIf you see a screen appear that looks like the one pictured below, press the blue continue button. You should then be connected to the remote host.\\n\\nUNIX\\nIf you are trying to access a Windows host via RDP from UNIX, you should use the xfreerdp client from the command line. This should be preinstalled, so there is no configuration that needs to happen.\\nTo connect via RDP to a remote host with xfreerdp, type the following command, replacing values as appropriate: \\n\\nxfreerdp -d UMIACS -u <USERNAME> --plugin cliprdr -g <GEOMETRY> <HOSTNAME>\\nHere is an explanation of the values above:\\n\\n<GEOMETRY>: Percent of remote host\\'s screen to mirror on the client\\n<USERNAME>: Your UMIACS username (Do not include domain name)\\n<HOSTNAME>: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN) of the desired remote host\\n\\n\\nAs with any of these RDP solutions, closing xfreerdp (using the top bar or using CTRL+C) without logging out could cause considerable problems for other users of the workstation. If you are using a shared workstation, please be sure to logout after you are finished with the remote machine using the Start menu.\\n\\nRedirecting Resources on Windows\\nResource redirection must be set up before connection is established.\\n\\n\\nAudio Redirection\\nThis allows the remote desktop to access the audio capture and playback devices on the user\\'s desktop.\\n\\n\\nClick the \"Show Options\" drop down menu\\nNavigate to the \"Local Resources\" tab\\nClick the \"Settings\" button in the Remote audio box\\nSelect preferred audio preferences\\nSelect \"OK\\nSelect \"Connect\"\\n\\n\\nOther Resource Redirection\\nThis allows the remote desktop to access the drives, printers, and video capture devices on the user\\'s desktop.\\n\\n\\nClick the \"Show Options\" drop down menu.\\nNavigate to the \"Local Resources\" tab.\\nClick the \"More\" button in the Local devices and resources box.\\nClick the checkbox next to the resources you would like to redirect.\\nSelect \"OK\".\\nSelect \"Connect\".\\n\\n\\nRedirecting Resources on Mac\\nIf you have already created the PC connection, right click over the PC connection you wish to add resource redirection to, then select \\'Edit\\'.\\n\\n\\nFolder/Drive Redirection\\nThis allows the remote machine to access specified folders on your local machine.\\n\\n\\nLocated halfway down the screen, select the \\'Folders\\' tab.\\nCheck the box titled \\'Redirect folders,\\' if not checked already.\\nEither select the folder(s) already listed you wish to access from the remote machine by checking the box next to the desired folder, or select the \\'+\\' button, then import and select the folder(s) you wish to access.\\nPress the blue \\'Add\\' button in the bottom right corner, or if you wish to direct other resources as well, see \\'Other Resource Redirection\\' below.\\n\\nOther Resource Redirection\\nThis will allow for camera, printer, and/or microphone access to be shared between machines.\\n\\n\\nLocated halfway down the screen, select the \\'Devices and Audio\\' tab.\\nEnsure the boxes next to the services you would like to redirect are checked. For video, ensure that the \\'Microphone\\' and \\'Camera\\' boxes are checkmarked. For printer access, ensure that the \\'Printers\\' box is checkmarked. Please be mindful to keep \\'Clipboard\\' checkmarked, as that is what allows you to copy and paste between your local machine and the remote machine.\\nPress the blue \\'Add\\' button in the bottom right corner.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Remote_Desktop&oldid=12144\"',\n",

See:  Installing R for Windows.\\n\\nRetrieving Installation Files\\nVisit http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\\nThere are two ways to install RStudio:\\n\\nThe installer, which is found under Installers for Supported Platforms; click the appropriate Windows download link, and run the installer\\nThe archive, which is found under Zip/Tarballs; click the appropriate Windows download link, and extract the archive contents to an installation directory of your choice\\n\\n\\nIt is recommended to use the second option, as this will allow you to skip this next section (go directly to  Running RStudio). If using the installer, proceed to the next section.\\n\\nUsing the Installer\\nAfter retrieving the .exe installer, run it. Step through the installation while following the below steps.\\nWhen prompted for an install location, specify a location within your home directory. Remember this location.\\n\\nOn the next install step, checking \"Do not create shortcuts\" is recommended, as the RStudio folder it creates will likely just be empty.\\n\\nProceed with the finishing steps of the installation.\\n\\nRunning RStudio\\nNavigate to the directory you just installed RStudio to (this is the install location you specified in the installer, or the extraction destination of the archive). In this directory, open bin, and find the rstudio.exe file. Running this will open up RStudio.

       " 'Screen\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nContents\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n2 Usage\\n3 Common Keyboard Shortcuts\\n4 Important Notes\\n5 .screenrc\\n6 Useful Links\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\nGNU Screen, or \"screen\", is a window management program available on UMIACS Linux hosts that allows multiplexing of a single terminal between multiple virtual consoles. Screen is also capable of separating programs from the shell that initially started it which allows a program to continue running even if the connection to the host has been lost. For this reason screen is typically used when a network connection is unstable and the process must remain running even if an SSH connection has dropped. Screen is also useful when a process may be slow and other processes need to be running. \\n\\nUsage\\nTo invoke screen, simply use the following command in a terminal:\\n\\n# screen\\n\\nAlternatively, to start a program with screen:\\n\\n# screen vi program.c\\n\\nThis will invoke screen and, in the newly-created window, start editing the file program.c in vi.\\nYou can have as many screen sessions as you’d like on a single host, however, keeping track of many sessions can become difficult. As a way to solve this screen offers the capability to give each session a unique name when you start it using the following:\\n\\n# screen -S [session name]\\n\\nIf you need to end your ssh session, but want your processes to keep running you can detach the screen session with:\\n\\n# screen -d\\n\\nThen exit as normal.\\nIf you have multiple screen sessions you can detach and reattach them at any time. To list the current screen sessions running on a host use:\\n\\n# screen -ls\\n\\nThe output will be similar to this:\\n\\n# username@tron02:~$ screen -ls\\n#  There are screens on:\\n# \\t26598.screenTest1\\t(Detached)\\n# \\t18457.pts-0.tron02\\t(Detached)\\n# 2 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-username.\\n\\nTo reconnect to a specific screen session you may use either the screen number or name to reconnect using ‘screen -r’\\n\\n# username@tron02:~$ screen -r 26598\\n\\nor\\n\\n# username@tron02:~$ screen -r screenTest1\\n\\nCommon Keyboard Shortcuts\\nCtrl-A is the metacharacter for commands in screen; press it before every key command.  Some useful commands in screen:\\n\\nCtrl-A + c (Creates a new window.)\\nCtrl-A + d (detach from current session)\\nCtrl-A + [0-9] (Switches to the window corresponding to the number, window 0 is the first window initialized by screen.)\\nCtrl-A + \" (Presents a selection of screen windows from which to choose.)\\nCtrl-A + Shift-A Rename the current screen window\\nCtrl-A + <SPC> / Ctrl-A + <BKSPC> (Switch to the next / previous window.)\\nCtrl-A + k (Kill the current window.)\\nCtrl-A + \\\\ (Kill the screen session and all its windows.)\\n\\n\\nSee the documentation here to see a full list of Ctrl-A commands (Section 5.1: Default Key Bindings).\\n\\nImportant Notes\\nIf you start a screen session that will run a program within a session that has only one window, such as by issuing the command \\n\\n# screen program.c \\n\\nthen when the program exits the screen session will terminate as well. This has the potential to hide any output you may want from your program since the screen session will exit. To solve this issue you can either make sure your shell is not set to auto-logout, or ensure that you have multiple windows open in the screen session so that it will not terminate when the program exits.\\n\\n.screenrc\\nSimilar to .bashrc, the file .screenrc in a user\\'s home directory can be used to customize a screen session\\'s startup behavior.  Commands listed in this file will be executed upon starting screen, and can be useful to set up your environment to display important information such as the window number and name, the name of the host you\\'re connected to, or altering the key sequences for screen commands. See the link here for more information about screen commands (Section 5.2: Command Summary).\\n\\nUseful Links\\nThe main page at www.gnu.org.\\nGNU Screen documentation (also accessed through man screen).\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Screen&oldid=10377\"',\n",

By default, use of SSH brings the user to a terminal, but the protocol can be used for other types of data transfer such as SFTP and SCP.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Connecting to an SSH Server\\n2 X11 Forwarding\\n3 SSH Tunneling\\n4 SSH Keys (and Passwordless SSH)\\n5 Verify remote host SSH fingerprint\\n\\n5.1 Windows / PuTTY Verification\\n5.2 Other Platforms\\n\\n\\n6 Long Running Processes\\n7 Further Information\\n\\n\\nConnecting to an SSH Server\\nUnder Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus.\\n\\n# ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nNote: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.\\n\\nThis will give you access to a terminal on any one of the Nexus servers.  Note that by default you will not have access to applications that require X11 to run.\\nAll UMIACS-supported Windows hosts are installed with PuTTY. If you are using a self-supported machine, you can either download and install PuTTY yourself, or if you are running a currently supported version of Windows, you can install the OpenSSH client natively in Windows by following Microsoft\\'s instructions here. Only the client is needed and not the server.\\n\\nX11 Forwarding\\nBy default, SSH only gives the user shell access to a host.  Enabling X11 Forwarding allows users to run applications with Graphical User Interfaces.\\nUnder Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus using X11 Forwarding. Please note that under macOS, xQuartz is required on the client machine to forward X sessions from the remote session.\\n\\n# ssh -Y username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nNote: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.\\n\\nUnder Windows, you will need to forward X through VcXsrv or another X11 application.\\nIf using PuTTY, you will need to enable X forwarding. The option is under Connection > SSH > X11, shown below.\\n\\nIf using the Windows Terminal app, you will need to set an environment variable and then relaunch the app.\\n\\nsetx.exe DISPLAY \"127.0.0.1:0.0\"\\n\\n\\nAfter this has been done, every time you want to use X forwarding, you need to make sure VcXsrv or your other application has been started. If using VcXsrv, there will be an icon in your system tray.\\nYou will now be able to use Xwindow programs from your SSH client.\\n\\nSSH Tunneling\\nYou can tunnel one or more ports through an SSH connection such that your packets will look like they are coming from the host you are tunneling to.   This is helpful for services that you would be normally blocked by a firewall.\\nPlease see the SecureShellTunneling page for more information.\\n\\nSSH Keys (and Passwordless SSH)\\nSSH can utilize public key encryption to authenticate and authorize users. This can be considered more secure especially if you secure your private key with a pass-phrase. The keys themselves are not susceptible to brute force attacks like normal passwords over SSH are.\\nPlease see the SSH/Keys page for more information.\\nNote: UMIACS still requires multi-factor authentication if you are connecting from the public internet for security reasons. If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.\\n\\nVerify remote host SSH fingerprint\\nThe SSH protocol relies on host keys to verify the identify of a given host.  Each host as a unique key for the various different protocols supported.  \\nWhen connecting to a remove host for the first time, or when the remote host\\'s local host key configuration has changed, you may see the following prompt:\\n\\n$ ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nThe authenticity of host \\'nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.73)\\' can\\'t be established.\\nRSA key fingerprint is 25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f.\\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\\n\\nIt is considered best practice to verify the key fingerprint with the actual key of the host.  UMIACS maintains a reference of SSH key fingerprints available at the following link: \\nhttps://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys\\nIt is important to note that each key type has a different fingerprint.  Depending on your local configuration, your client may prefer a specific type of key.  The following commands can be used to determine the fingerprint of a given key type on a remote host:\\n\\n$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu > key\\n# nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0\\n$ ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f key\\n2048 MD5:25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (RSA)\\n\\nIf you have any questions, or notice a discrepancy, please  contact staff.\\n\\nWindows / PuTTY Verification\\nIf you use PuTTY to connect to remote hosts, the prompt will be similar to the following:\\n\\nIf the host key reported by PuTTY matches the Documented entry for that host, it is safe to click \\'yes\\'.  If they do not match, please report the issue to staff@umiacs.umd.edu.\\n\\nOther Platforms\\nWinSCP\\nMobaXterm\\n\\n\\nLong Running Processes\\nIf you are dealing with a long running process that is inhibiting your ability to work regularly, you may want to run your processes inside a screen on the host that you\\'re connecting to. This way, if the connection is dropped for any reason the screen session will automatically detach on the host and will continue running so that you can reattach it at a later time when you\\'ve connected again.

Public-facing hosts are hosts that are reachable via the Internet (e.g. via ping) without first establishing a connection to our VPN. If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border).\\nSSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and  public key authentication. Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically. Other hardware tokens such as a YubiKey or Duo\\'s own hardware token will still work.\\n\\nExample\\nThe initial command or session setup for connecting to a host with multi-factor authentication enabled over SSH is the same as one that does not have it enabled. Our example for connecting to a host over SSH can be found  here. In the below example, we are also SSH-ing to a Nexus node e.g. ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nOnce you enter the command (if using a native terminal) or start the session (PuTTY or other terminal emulators), you will be presented with the following prompt:\\n\\nPassword:\\n\\nEnter your UMIACS password here (the same as if you were using interactive password authentication to connect to an internal host). After correctly entering your password, you will be taken to the following prompt. Please note: The options shown here will vary depending on what/how many devices you have registered with our Duo instance. In this example, we have a mobile phone that has the Duo app installed, a tablet (iPad) that has the Duo app installed, a Duo hardware token, and a YubiKey all registered against our UMIACS Duo instance.\\n\\nPassword:\\nDuo two-factor login for username\\n\\nEnter a passcode or select one of the following options:\\n\\n 1.

You can also enter the passcode \\n\\nDuo Push to ___\\nThis will send a push notification to the Duo app on whichever device you chose for you to accept to proceed.\\n\\nPasscode or option (1-4): 1\\n\\nPushed a login request to your device...\\n\\nPhone call to XXX-XXX-XXXX\\nThis will call your registered phone and ask you to press any key on your phone to proceed.\\n\\nPasscode or option (1-4): 3\\n\\nCalling your phone...\\nDialing XXX-XXX-1234...\\n\\n(After answering) \\n\\nAnswered.

As mentioned previously, you do not need an additional multi-factor authentication step when using SSH if you first connect to our VPN since it is already secured by multi-factor authentication.\\nAn alternative would be to use a terminal multiplexer such as Screen or Tmux to minimize the number of times you need to multi-factor authenticate.

       " 'SetGID\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nThe setgid bit works in two ways, one for files and one for directories.\\n\\nSetGID Files\\nThe setgid bit for files will force when a file is executed to set its group ID to the GID that of the binary instead of the user that is running it.  This mode has no effect for files that are not executable.  To a lesser extent than SetUID this can lead to security issues when the group in question has some files that would be allowed to be read or written when otherwise not permitted.  There are very limited uses for this feature these days and its use is discouraged.\\n\\nSetGID Directories\\nSetGID directories have a much more benign behavior.  When this bit is set on a directory all filesystem creations underneath that directory will inherit the group from the directory.  UMIACS policy is to keep users\\' default UID and GID.  So for users who wish to have certain directory trees have consistent groups the use of SetGID directories is useful.  The SetGID directory bit will force all files created under that directory to have the same GID.  Any directories created will also be given the same GID and the SetGID bit so that the same policy is applied at the next level of directory down.\\nBefore we give an example of how to use the sticky bit please see the documentation about umask.  SetGID will only work on the GID and the setting a sticky bit and will not change any other permissions.  By default the umask is 022 and is a bit too restrictive for the use of SetGID effectively.  (002 or 007 will be the appropriate setting depending if you want Others to be able to read/execute or not)\\nFirst an example of what our default group is and what other groups we belong to:\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ id\\nuid=9001(username) gid=29001(username) groups=15114(umadmin),29001(username)\\n\\nNow we have created a directory called staff that we want to share with the umadmin group (which is not my default group)\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .\\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 username username   96 Jun 16 11:34 .\\n\\nWe are going to set the new group to umadmin and set rwxrwxr-x permissions.  Then finally we will add the SetGID bit.\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chgrp umadmin .\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod 775 .\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod g+s .\\n\\nNow you can see we have a directory that is correctly set up,\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .\\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 11:34 .\\n\\nWe are going to use umask of 002 since we want to allow others to read the files.\\nWe are going to now create a test file and test directory,\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ touch test\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ mkdir testdir\\n\\nNow as you can see we have the correct groups and permissions being used to create both files directories,\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la\\ndrwxrwsr-x  3 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 .\\n-rw-rw-r--  1 username umadmin    0 Jun 16 12:58 test\\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 testdir\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SetGID&oldid=9837\"',\n",

It provides three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive or non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n Submitting Jobs\\n Checking Job Status\\n Checking Cluster Status\\n Understanding Job Priority\\n Job Preemption Overview\\nOfficial Documentation\\nFAQ\\n\\n\\nRelated documentation:\\n\\n Optimizing Storage Performance\\n Using VS Code\\n\\n\\nCommands\\nBelow are some of the common commands used in Slurm. Further information on how to use these commands is found in the documentation linked above. To see all flags available for a command, please check the command\\'s manual by using man <COMMAND> on the command line.\\n\\nsrun\\nsrun runs a parallel job on a cluster managed by Slurm.  If necessary, it will first create a resource allocation in which to run the parallel job.\\n\\nsalloc\\nsalloc allocates a Slurm job allocation, which is a set of resources (nodes), possibly with some set of constraints (e.g. number of processors per node).  When salloc successfully obtains the requested allocation, it then runs the command specified by the user.  Finally, when the user specified command is complete, salloc relinquishes the job allocation.  If no command is specified, salloc runs the user\\'s default shell.\\n\\nsbatch\\nsbatch submits a batch script to Slurm.  The batch script may be given to sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified, sbatch will read in a script from standard input.  The batch script may contain options preceded with #SBATCH before any executable commands in the script.\\n\\nsqueue\\nsqueue views job and job step information for jobs managed by Slurm.\\n\\nscancel\\nscancel signals or cancels jobs, job arrays, or job steps.  An arbitrary number of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a space separated list of specific job and/or job step IDs.\\n\\nsacct\\nsacct displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log file or Slurm database in a variety of forms for your analysis.  The sacct command displays information on jobs, job steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output with the use of the --format= option to specify the fields to be shown.\\n\\nsstat\\nsstat displays job status information for your analysis.  The sstat command displays information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node, Resident Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory (VM).  You can tailor the output with the use of the --fields= option to specify the fields to be shown.\\n\\nModules\\nIf you are trying to use  GNU Modules in a Slurm job, please read the section of our Modules documentation on  non-interactive shell sessions.  This also needs to be done if the OS version of the compute node you are scheduled on is different from the OS version of the submission node you are submitting the job from.\\n\\nRunning Jupyter Notebook on a Compute Node\\nThe steps to run a Jupyter Notebook from a compute node are listed below.\\n\\nSetting up your Python Virtual Environment\\n Create a Python virtual environment on the compute node you are assigned and  activate it. Next, install Jupyter using pip by following the steps here. You may also use other environment management systems such as Conda if desired.\\n\\nRunning Jupyter Notebook\\nAfter you\\'ve set up the Python virtual environment, submit a job, activate the environment within the job, and run the following command on the compute node you are assigned:\\n\\njupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 --ip=0.0.0.0\\n\\nThis will start running the notebook on port 8889. Note: You must keep this shell window open to be able to connect. If the submission node for the cluster you are using is not accessible via the public internet, you must also be on a machine connected to the UMIACS network or connected to our  VPN in order to access the Jupyter notebook once you start the SSH tunnel, so ensure this is the case before starting the tunnel. Then, on your local machine, run\\n\\nssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:<NODENAME>:8889 <USERNAME>@<SUBMISSIONNODE>.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nThis will tunnel port 8889 from the compute node to port 8888 on your local machine, using <SUBMISSIONNODE> as an intermediate node. Make sure to replace <USERNAME> with your username, <SUBMISSIONNODE> with the name of the submission node you want to use, and <NODENAME> with the name of the compute node you are assigned. Note that this command will not display any output if the connection is successful due to the included ssh flags. You must also keep this shell window open to be able to connect.\\nFor example, assuming your username is username and that you are using the Nexus cluster, have been  assigned the nexusgroup submission nodes, and are assigned compute node tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:\\n\\nssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:8889 username@nexusgroup.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nYou can then open a web browser and type in localhost:8888 to access the notebook.\\nNotes:\\n\\nLater versions of Jupyter have token authentication enabled by default - you will need to prepend the /?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX part of the URL provided by the terminal output after starting the notebook in order to connect if this is the case. e.g. localhost:8888/?token=fcc6bd0f996e7aa89376c33cb34f7b80890502aacc97d98e\\nIf the port on the compute node mentioned in the example above (8889) is not working, it may be that someone else has already started a process (Jupyter notebook or otherwise) using that specific port number on that specific compute node. The port number can be replaced with any other ephemeral port number you\\'d like, just make sure to change it in both the command you run on the compute node and the ssh command from your local machine.\\n\\n\\nQuick Guide to translate PBS/TORQUE to Slurm\\nPBS/TORQUE was the previous workload manager and job submission framework used at UMIACS prior to Slurm\\'s adoption.

Use show_qos and show_partition_qos to identify the limit(s) and then use scontrol show job <jobid> for each of your jobs running in that QoS to see the resources they are currently consuming.\\nAssocGrpBilling - The SLURM account you are using has a limit on the overall billing amount available in total for the account.  Use sacctmgr show assoc account=<accountname> where user= to identify the limit, replacing <accountname> with the account you are submitting your job with.  You can see all jobs running under the account and their billing values by running squeue -A <accountname> -O \"JobId:.18 ,Partition:.9 ,Name:.8 ,UserName:.8 ,StateCompact:.2 ,TimeUsed:.10 ,NumNodes:.6 ,ReasonList:45 ,tres-alloc:80\". The billing value will be part of the tres-alloc string for each job.\\nReqNodeNotAvail - None of the nodes that could run your job (based on requested partition/resources) currently have the resources to fit your job.  Alternatively, if you also see Reserved for maintenance, there is a reservation in place (often for a  maintenance window).  You can see the current reservations by running scontrol show reservation.  Often the culprit is that you have requested a TimeLimit that will conflict with the reservation.  You can either lower your TimeLimit such that the job will complete before the reservation begins, or leave your job to wait until the reservation completes.\\n\\n\\nSLURM\\'s full list of reasons/explanations can be found here.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/JobStatus&oldid=12005\"',\n",

It is important to understand the different options available and how to request the resources required for a job in order for it to run successfully. All job submission should be done from submit nodes; any computational code should be run in a job allocation on compute nodes. The following commands outline how to allocate resources on the compute nodes and submit processes to be run on the allocated nodes.\\nThe cluster that everyone with a  UMIACS account has access to is Nexus. Please visit the Nexus page for instructions on how to connect to your assigned submit nodes.\\nComputationally intensive processes run on submission nodes will be terminated. Please submit jobs to be scheduled on compute nodes for this purpose.\\nFor details on how SLURM decides how to schedule jobs when multiple jobs are waiting in a scheduler\\'s queue, please see SLURM/Priority.\\n\\nsrun\\nThe srun command is used to run a process on the compute nodes in the cluster. If you pass it a normal shell command (or command that executes a script), it will submit a job to run that shell command/script on a compute node and then return. srun accepts many command line options to specify the resources required by the command passed to it. Some common command line arguments are listed below and full documentation of all available options is available in the man page for srun, which can be accessed by running man srun.\\n\\n$ srun --qos=default --mem=100mb --time=1:00:00 bash -c \\'echo \"Hello World from\" `hostname`\\'\\nHello World from tron33.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nIt is important to understand that srun is an interactive command. By default input to srun is broadcast to all compute nodes running your process and output from the compute nodes is redirected to srun. This behavior can be changed; however, srun will always wait for the command passed to finish before exiting, so if you start a long running process and end your terminal session, your process will stop running on the compute nodes and your job will end. To run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with  sbatch.\\n\\nCommon srun Arguments\\n--job-name=<JOBNAME> Requests your job be named <JOBNAME>\\n--mem=1g Requests 1GB of memory for your job, if no unit is given MB is assumed\\n--ntasks=2 Requests 2 \"tasks\" which map to cores on a CPU for your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each core\\n--nodes=2 Requests 2 nodes be allocated to your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each node\\n--nodelist=<NODENAME> Requests to run your job on the <NODENAME> node\\n--time=dd-hh:mm:ss Requests your job run for dd days, hh hours, mm minutes, and ss seconds\\n--error=<ERRNAME> Redirects stderr for your job to the <ERRNAME> file\\n--partition=<PARTITIONNAME> Requests your job run in the <PARTITIONNAME> partition\\n--qos=<QOSNAME>default Requests your job run with the <QOSNAME> QOS, to see the available QOS options on a cluster, run show_qos\\n--account=<ACCOUNTNAME> Requests your job runs under the <ACCOUNTNAME> Slurm account, different accounts have different available partitions/QOS\\n--output=<OUTNAME> Redirects stdout for your job to the <OUTNAME> file\\n--requeue Requests your job be automatically requeued if it is preempted\\n--exclusive Requests your job be the only one running on the node(s) it is assigned to. This requires that your job be allocated all of the resources on the node(s). The scheduler does not automatically give your job all of the node\\'s/nodes\\' resources, however, so if you need more than the default, you still need to request these with --ntasks and --mem\\n\\n\\nInteractive Shell Sessions\\nAn interactive shell session on a compute node can be useful for debugging or developing code that isn\\'t ready to be run as a batch job. To get an interactive shell on a node, use srun with the --pty argument to invoke a shell:\\n\\n$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash\\n$ hostname\\ntron33.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nPlease do not leave interactive shells running for long periods of time when you are not working. This blocks resources from being used by everyone else.\\n\\nsalloc\\nThe salloc command can also be used to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script. Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation. When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.\\n\\n$ salloc --qos=default -N 1 --mem=2g --time=01:00:00\\nsalloc: Granted job allocation 159\\n$ srun /usr/bin/hostname\\ntron33.umiacs.umd.edu\\n$ exit\\nexit\\nsalloc: Relinquishing job allocation 159\\n\\nPlease note that any commands not invoked with srun will be run locally on the submit node. Please be careful when using salloc.\\n\\nsbatch\\nThe sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes. To run a simple Hello World command on the compute nodes you could write a file, helloWorld.sh with the following contents:\\n\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\nsrun bash -c \\'echo Hello World from `hostname`\\'\\n\\nThen you need to submit the script with sbatch and request resources:\\n\\n$ sbatch --qos=default --mem=1g --time=1:00:00 helloWorld.sh\\nSubmitted batch job 121\\n\\nSLURM will return a job number that you can use to check the status of your job with squeue:\\n\\n$ squeue\\n             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\\n               121      tron helloWor username  R       0:01      1 tron32\\n\\nAdvanced Batch Scripts\\nYou can also write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself. This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one \"job step\". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node.

In SLURM, GPUs are considered \"generic resources\" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:#. If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec\\'d GPU.\\nNote that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs.\\n\\n$ srun --pty --qos=medium --gres=gpu:2 nvidia-smi\\n...\\nWed Mar  6 16:59:39 2024\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     |\\n|-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\\n| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Here we are documenting some Slurm behaviors that you can use to determine if your job has been cancelled or preempted. You should be able to take different code paths during startup/shutdown of your jobs based on this information.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Flowchart for job cancellation/preemption\\n\\n1.1 Cancellation\\n1.2 Preemption/Requeue\\n\\n\\n2 Key takeaways\\n\\n2.1 On job cancellation/preemption\\n2.2 On resuming\\n\\n\\n3 Testing\\n\\n\\nFlowchart for job cancellation/preemption\\nCancellation\\nSlurm controller sends an internal cancel signal to Slurm node(s) where the job is currently assigned.\\nSlurm node(s) send SIGCONT and SIGTERM around the same time, and the following fields of note are set in the output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID:\\njob_state = [\\'CANCELLED\\', \\'COMPLETING\\']\\n\\n\\nIf the processes don\\'t stop within a certain amount of time, eventually SIGKILL will be sent.\\n\\n\\nPreemption/Requeue\\nSlurm controller sends an internal preemption/requeue signal to Slurm node(s) where the job is currently assigned.\\nSlurm node(s) send SIGCONT and SIGTERM around the same time, and the following fields of note are set in the output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID:\\njob_state = [\\'PENDING\\', \\'COMPLETING\\']\\nrestart_cnt += 1\\n\\n\\nIf the processes don\\'t stop within a certain amount of time, eventually SIGKILL will be sent.\\nOnce the job is stopped, it enters the PENDING state for two minutes, and then is eligible to be run again.\\nWhen the job runs again, an additional environment variable will be defined, SLURM_RESTART_COUNT, which reports the number of times the job has been preempted/requeued.\\n\\n\\nKey takeaways\\nOn job cancellation/preemption\\nYou can handle the SIGTERM signal and run scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID within your script. Based on the value of job_state, your script can take a different codepath depending on if it was cancelled or was preempted.\\nThe output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID is equivalent to the Slurm REST API\\'s endpoint \"GET /slurm/v0.0.40/job/{job_id}\". For more information on how to parse the output of this scontrol command, please refer to Slurm\\'s REST API documentation. [1]\\n\\nOn resuming\\nIf your job needs to behave differently based on whether or not it was previously preempted, you can check if the environment variable SLURM_RESTART_COUNT is defined.\\n\\nTesting\\nYou can use the following commands to manually cancel and requeue your jobs (requeueing and preemption are handled similarly). With these tools, you can test your scripts to ensure that they gracefully handle these scenarios.\\nCancellation: scancel <job id>\\nPreemption: scontrol requeue <job id>\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/Preemption&oldid=11792\"',\n",
       " 'SLURM/Priority\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nSLURM at UMIACS is configured to prioritize jobs based on a number of factors, termed multifactor priority in SLURM. Each job submitted to the scheduler is assigned a priority value, which can be viewed in the output of scontrol show job <jobid>.\\nExample:\\n\\n$ scontrol show job 1\\nJobId=1 JobName=bash\\n   UserId=username(13337) GroupId=username(13337) MCS_label=N/A\\n   Priority=10841 Nice=0 Account=nexus QOS=default\\n...\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Pending Jobs\\n2 Priority Factors\\n\\n2.1 Age\\n2.2 Association\\n2.3 Partition\\n2.4 Fair-share\\n\\n2.4.1 GPU partitions\\n2.4.2 CPU-only partitions\\n\\n\\n2.5 Nice value\\n\\nPending Jobs\\nIf the partition that you submit your job to cannot instantly begin your job due to no compute node(s) having the resources free to run it, your job will remain in the Pending state with the listed reason (Resources). If there is another job already pending with this reason, you submit a job to the same partition, and your job gets assigned a lower priority value than that pending job, your job will instead remain in the Pending state with reason (Priority). If there are multiple jobs pending and your job is not the highest priority job pending, the scheduler will only begin execution of your job if starting your job would not push the begin times for any higher priority jobs in the same partition further back.\\nLowering some combination of the resources you are requesting and/or the time limit may allow submitted jobs to run more quickly or instantly during times where a partition is under resource pressure. The command squeue -j <jobid> --start can be used to provide a time estimate for when your job will start, where <jobid> is the job ID you receive from either srun or sbatch.\\nYou can use the command alias  show_available_nodes with a variety of different submission arguments to get a better idea of what jobs may be able to begin sooner.\\n\\nPriority Factors\\nThe priority factors in use at UMIACS include:\\n\\nAge of job i.e. time spent waiting to run in the queue\\nAssociation (SLURM account) being used\\nPartition job was submitted to\\nFair-share of resources\\n\"Nice\" value that job was submitted with\\n\\n\\nAge\\nThe longer a job is eligible to run but cannot due to resources being unavailable, the higher the job\\'s priority becomes as it continue to wait in the queue. The priority modifier for this factor reaches its limit after 7 days.\\n\\nAssociation\\nSome lab/center-specific SLURM accounts may have priority values directly attached to them. Jobs run under these accounts gain this many extra points of priority.\\n\\nPartition\\nThe partitions whose names are or are prefixed with scavenger on each of our clusters always have lower priority factors for their jobs than all other partitions on that cluster. As mentioned in other UMIACS cluster-specific documentation, jobs submitted to these partitions are also preemptable. These two design choices give the partitions their names; jobs submitted to scavenger named or prefixed partitions \"scavenge\" for available resources on the cluster rather than consume dedicated resources, and are interrupted by jobs asking to consume dedicated resources.\\nOn Nexus, labs/centers may also have their own scavenger partitions (<labname>-scavenger) if the faculty for the lab/center have decided upon some sort of limit on jobs (number of simultaneous jobs, number of actively consumed billing resources, etc.) in their non-scavenger partitions. These lab/center scavenger partitions allow for more jobs to be run by members of that lab/center on that lab\\'s/center\\'s nodes only, but are preemptable by that lab\\'s/center\\'s non-scavenger partition jobs.\\nIn decreasing order of priority (highest first), our priority tiers for partitions are:\\n\\nAccount-specific non-preemptable partitions\\nLab/center-specific non-\"scavenger\" named partitions\\nLab/center-specific \"scavenger\" named partitions\\nInstitute-wide scavenger partitions\\n\\n\\nA job in a lower priority tier will never have a higher priority value than any job in any of the higher priority tiers.\\n\\nFair-share\\nThe more resources your jobs have already consumed within an account, the lower priority factor your future jobs will have when compared to other users\\' jobs in the same account who have used fewer resources (so as to \"fair-share\" with other users). Additionally, if there are multiple accounts that can submit to a partition, and the sum of resources of all users\\' jobs within account A is greater than the sum of resources of all users\\' jobs within account B, the lower priority factor all future jobs from users in account A will have when compared to all future jobs from users in account B. (In other words, fair-share is hierarchical.)\\nYou can view the various fair-share statistics with the command sshare -l. It will show your specific FairShare values (always between 0.0 and 1.0) within accounts that you have access to. You can also view other accounts\\' Level Fairshare (LevelFS).\\n\\nAccount                    User  RawShares  NormShares    RawUsage   NormUsage  EffectvUsage  FairShare    LevelFS

the TRESBillingWeights line in the output of scontrol show partition. The billing value for a job is the sum of all resource weightings for resources the job has requested. This value is then multiplied by the amount of time a job has run in seconds to get the amount it contributes to the RawUsage for the association within the account it is running under.\\nThe algorithm we use for resource weightings differs depending on if there are any GPUs in a partition or not, and is as follows:\\n\\nGPU partitions\\nEach resource (memory/CPU/GPU) is given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (33.33% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU/GPU values are adjusted accordingly.\\nDifferent GPU types may also be weighted differently within the GPU relative billing. A baseline GPU type is first chosen. All GPUs of that type and other types that have lower FP32 performance (in TFLOPS) are given a weighting factor of 1.0. GPU types with higher FP32 performance than the baseline GPU are given a weighting factor calculated by dividing their FP32 performance by the baseline GPU\\'s FP32 performance. The weighting values for each GPU type are then determined by normalizing the sum of all of GPU cards\\' billing values multiplied by their weighting factors against the relative billing percentage for GPUs (33.33%).\\nThe current baseline GPU is the NVIDIA RTX A4000.\\n\\nCPU-only partitions\\nEach resource (memory/CPU) is first given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (50% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU value is adjusted accordingly. The final CPU weight value is then divided by 10, which ends up translating to roughly 90.9% of the billing weight being for memory and 9.1% being for CPU. The division of the CPU value is done so as to not affect accounts\\' fair-share priority factors as much when running CPU-only jobs given the popularity of GPU computing.\\n\\nNice value\\nThis is a submission argument that you as the user can include when submitting your jobs to deprioritize them. Larger values will deprioritize jobs more e.g.,\\n\\nsrun --pty --nice=2 bash\\nwill have lower priority than\\n\\nsrun --pty --nice=1 bash\\nwhich will have lower priority than\\n\\nsrun --pty bash\\nassuming all three jobs were submitted at the same time. You cannot use negative values for this argument.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/Priority&oldid=12154\"',\n",

If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\n\\nThe  SSH Agents section is not a required component of creating and using an SSH key, but can be very useful if you choose to create a password to protect your SSH key, but find yourself needing to enter that password many times in a session.  SSH Agents allow you to temporarily use your SSH key without a password for a set period of time. Please see the  SSH Agents section for more information.\\n\\n\\nCreate and store the key pair\\nThe first step is to generate a key which will create two files filled with long strings of characters.  A public key file that you may distribute to any machine you want to use it on and a private key that needs to be kept secure.  Allowing anyone to read this private key will compromise the security of the key and could allow someone to access any resources secured by this key without your consent. There are a number of different key types but rsa is the most compatible.  \\n\\nWindows\\nGit Bash\\nSee  Linux/MacOS/Bash and Git Bash (for Windows)\\nPuTTY\\n\\n\\nClick on the start menu and search for PuTTYgen. Open the application\\nVerify that you are attempting to create an \"SSH2 RSA\" key by clicking on the appropriate box\\nClick generate and follow the instructions for generating your keys\\nAdd passphrase if wanted and save both the public and private keys\\n\\n\\nTTSSH2\\n\\n\\nOpen the application\\nCancel the first box\\nGo to setup on the menu bar and go to SSH KeyGenerator\\nClick generate and follow the instructions for generating your key\\nAdd passphrase if wanted and save both the public and private keys\\n\\n\\nLinux/MacOS/Bash and Git Bash (for Windows)\\nCreate a new key with a password\\n\\n\\nYou can run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa to generate the new public and private key.  It will prompt you for a file to create the private key and then for the public key append .pub extension and store it in the same directory.  Pressing enter at the passphrase step twice will create a key without a pass-phrase.\\nNote: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with \\'id\\', such as \\'id_umiacs_rsa\\'.\\n\\nExample: \\n\\n-bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa\\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):\\nCreated directory \\'/home/username/.ssh\\'.\\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\\nEnter same passphrase again:\\nYour identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.\\nYour public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\\nThe key fingerprint is:\\n32:bf:db:74:1b:7e:d7:c6:4b:b5:6f:a8:82:55:3f:bf username@localhost.localdomain\\nThe key\\'s randomart image is:\\n+--[ RSA 2048]----+\\n|                 |\\n|                 |\\n|                 |\\n|            .    |\\n|      o S  . .  .|\\n|       +  .   o o|\\n|        .o. o  B.|\\n|        .+.o o+ O|\\n|        o...+o E+|\\n+-----------------+\\n\\nCreate a new key without a password\\n\\n\\nYou can simplify the existing example above by telling it you do not want a pass-phrase and can run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\".\\nNote: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with \\'id\\', such as \\'id_umiacs_rsa\\'.\\n\\nExample: \\n\\n-bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\"\\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):\\nCreated directory \\'/home/username/.ssh\\'.\\nYour identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.\\nYour public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\\nThe key fingerprint is:\\nff:7a:99:28:fc:63:d6:10:44:4c:2e:68:76:44:76:7a username@localhost.localdomain\\nThe key\\'s randomart image is:\\n+--[ RSA 2048]----+\\n|       .+++      |\\n|       + +o      |\\n|      + +.E      |\\n|     o . o.      |\\n|        S  .     |\\n|         ..      |\\n|       .  .+ o   |\\n|        o =.=    |\\n|         =o+.    |\\n+-----------------+\\n\\nModify permissions\\n\\n\\nModify the permissions of your .ssh directory as well as the private key file that you just created with chmod.\\n\\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh \\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\\n\\nIf you named your file something other than id_rsa, change id_rsa to the name of the file.\\n\\nCopy the public key\\nOnce you have a generated a key pair you will want to add it to one or more computers to allow you to access them.  \\n\\nWindows\\nFor Windows hosts you can use WinSCP to copy the public key file onto a remote host. The root file system for the Bash Subsystem for Windows is located under C:\\\\Users\\\\username>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\lxss\\\\\\n\\nLinux/MacOS/Bash and Git Bash (for Windows)\\nThis can be done with the ssh-copy-id command and it will prompt you the first time for your current password (NOT your pass-phrase). You can replace localhost with any other hostname you want to copy the key to. You can also specify an alternate user or identity file if you need to, please man ssh-copy-id for more information within your terminal. This command will ensure that not only it copies your key but secures the file so that no one can tamper and add additional authorized keys to the file on the remote host. \\n\\nExample: \\n\\n-bash-4.2$ ssh-copy-id localhost\\n/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\\n/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\\nusername@localhost\\'s password:\\n\\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\\n\\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh \\'localhost\\'\"\\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\\n\\nAdding Keys to SSH Clients (Windows Only)\\nPuTTY\\n\\n\\nOpen PuTTY and enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the host you wish to connect to.\\nGo to the Connections tab on the side panel and click on the data subsection.\\nUnder data enter your default user into the first box.

When creating a key for use with SLURM, follow the above instructions for creating keys without passwords.\\nAfter creating this key pair please make sure you follow the  copy the public key instructions above to localhost. This will ensure that your key will be usable on all the cluster nodes since they have a shared home directory.\\n\\nSSH Agents\\nWhile it is very useful to protect your SSH key pair with a pass-phrase it can very time consuming to re-type the pass-phrase over and over. SSH provides a agent that runs in the background and allow you add a key(s) to it with a time limit that they will be unlocked for.\\n\\nssh-agent bash\\nssh-add -t $TIME\\n\\nThe time specified by -t is specified in seconds.\\nExample:\\n(The following would start a bash shell with passwordless SSH active for 30 minutes.)\\n\\nssh-agent bash\\nssh-add -t 1800\\n\\nYou will be prompted for your passphrase and, when entered correctly, you will be able to SSH without entering a password. You can check what keys are load when you are running inside a ssh-agent by using the command ssh-add -l.\\n\\nExample: \\n\\nbash-4.2$ ssh-add -l\\n2048 ee:83:10:c8:2f:2c:17:5e:ef:80:42:7e:ff:75:9e:53 /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SSH/Keys&oldid=11867\"',\n",

More information can be found at the features page here\\n\\nPermissions and Troubleshooting\\nIf your Ubuntu machine is UMIACS-supported and you are the primary user, access to the Software Center should have been granted to you at the time the machine was installed. If you find that you do not have adequate permissions to install software from this portal, please  contact staff. Please provide both your hostname and username. \\n\\nLaunching Software Center in Ubuntu\\nOne way of launching the Ubuntu Software Center is by using the Dashboard. The dashboard can be opened by typing the meta key (commonly referred to as the Windows key). This will provide you with a search box. Type in \"Software Center\" and it should be within the first few results. You can alternatively launch it from the terminal by typing \"software-center\" (if it\\'s not in your path, the location is /usr/bin/software-center)\\n\\nKnown Issues\\nDue to the limitations of X forwarding, the Ubuntu Software Center cannot be used via X11 Forwarding. Any updates using the Ubuntu Software Center will therefore have to be done using the method mentioned above on the physical machine.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Ubuntu/SoftwareCenter&oldid=10304\"',\n",
       " 'Umask\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\numask is the way the UNIX operating system determines what default permissions that files and directories are created with.\\nWith no umask files are created with permissions 666 or 110110110 in binary, and directories are created with permissions 777 or 111111111 in binary.  The umask is represented similarly as three digits, each representing a 3 bits. For each bit that is set to 1 in the umask the corresponding bit of any files or directories that are created is set to 0. In binary operations it is equivelent to bitwise negating the umask and then doing a bitwise and on that negation and the default for the object being created. \\nThe three popular umasks are 022, 002 and 007.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 umask 022\\n2 umask 002\\n3 umask 007\\n4 umask 000\\n5 Setting umask\\n\\n\\numask 022\\nThis as the example shows above that you will get full rwx for the user, r-x for the group and r-x for other.  This is the default in almost all of our operating systems.\\n\\n        777  111 111 111\\n  umask 022  000 010 010   \\n      = 755  111 101 101\\n\\numask 002\\nThis would give full rwx for the user, full rwx for the group and give only r-x for other.  This is helpful when you want your default group (or a SetGID directory) to have full control over the files and directories you create while allowing everyone else read and execute permissions.\\n\\n        777  111 111 111\\n  umask 002  000 000 010   \\n      = 775  111 111 101\\n\\numask 007\\nThis will give the user and group full rwx permissions and give other no permissions.\\n\\n        777  111 111 111\\n  umask 007  000 000 111   \\n      = 770  111 111 000\\n\\numask 000\\nPlease never use this umask as it will give full control to user, group and other.   In other words it makes the directory or file world read, write and executable and can be a large security risk to you and your colleagues.\\n\\nSetting umask\\nYour umask is tied to your current shell and can be set with the shell builtin command umask. If issued without an argument the umask will return the current umask, occasionally omitting any leading zeros. To set a umask issue the umask command with umask you want to use.\\n\\n[gnorts:~] username% umask \\n022\\n[gnorts:~] username% umask 002\\n[gnorts:~] username% umask\\n002\\n\\n\\nHowever most of the time, you find yourself in a work environment where the same umask is what you want to use all the time, and you don\\'t want to have to think about it. In that you case you want to set your umask in your shell initialization file. For bash the initialization file is .profile or .bash_profile and for tcsh the initialization files is .cshrc or .tcshrc. These files behave mostly like scripts and the umask command can be entered without any additional syntax as seen in the example bellow:\\n\\n [username@nexuscfar01 ~]$ cat .cshrc \\n setenv EDITOR vim\\n umask 002\\n\\nOr for example if you use Bash you can run this command.\\n\\n echo \\'umask 002\\' >> ~/.bash_profile\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Umask&oldid=11013\"',\n",

They include the programs \\'lpr\\', \\'lprm\\', \\'lpq\\', and \\'lpstat\\'.\\nAll of the UNIX queues are configured to handle postscript. See the examples section for more information on how to print different file types.\\nBasic Commands\\n\\nlpr\\nUse `lpr -Pprintername filename.ps` to submit the postscript file named filename.ps to the printer queue named printername. If no filename is specified, lpr reads from standard input. If no printer name is specified, then the job is discarded by the print server.\\nAdditional options to specify media handling, page orientation, and double sided printing can be passed to the print spooler using one or more -Z options. Double sided printing is specified with -Zduplex. Page orientation is controlled with -Zportrait, -Zlandscape. Manual feed media (eg. transparencies) is specified with -Zmanual. Please note that not all printers support all -Z options.\\n\\nnscript\\nUse `nscript -Pprintername filename.txt` to send the text file named filename.txt to the printer named printername. If no filename is specified, then nscript reads from standard input.\\nNscript is a weak attempt to simulate Adobe Systems Incorporated nscript programs. It supports a handful of interesting arguments. With the \\'-G\\' argument, nscript generates gaudy output that includes header information on each page. The \\'-2\\' argument generates two column output and \\'-r\\' rotates the job\\'s orientation to landscape mode.\\n\\nlprm\\nUse \\'lprm -Pprintername\\' to remove jobs from the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it removes the first removable job in the queue. Given a job\\'s id as an argument, it will remove the specified job from the queue and you can remove all removable jobs from a queue with the argument \"all\".\\nYou are able to remove items from the queue that you have submitted from anywhere, not just the computer from which the job was submitted.\\n\\nlpq\\nUse \\'lpq -Pprintername\\' to get the status of the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it will print the printer queue, the host queried, and the number of jobs in the queue. With the -l argument, it will specify the id, queue rank, the total size of the job in bytes, and any errors encountered in processing the job.\\n\\nGenerate Postscript\\nPostscript is a Page Description Language that is understood by high quality printers and typically generated by applications. There is a lot of documentation about using and programming in postscript, but for our purposes you\\'ll just need to generate postscript from an existing text file.\\nYou can generate postscript from an existing text file with textps. For example, to convert the Message of the Day file to a postscript file try `textps ... > file.ps`.\\n\\nPreview your job\\nIt\\'s helpful to preview your postscript files before printing by calling Ghostview with `ghostview file.ps`.\\nHigher quality previewing is available using Ghostview\\'s derivativegv. You can call it as `gv file.ps`.\\nBoth commands should open a window that displays the contents of your postscript file.\\n\\nChoose a print queue\\nPrint queues are described here:  Print Queues.\\nYou can check list all the print queues with `lpq -a` and you can list just a single queue `lpq -Pprintername` -- eg. ps432-3208 with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.\\n\\nSend a print job\\nAfter you choose a suitable printer (eg. ps432-3208), you can send your postscript file to the printer with `lpr -Pps432-3208 file.ps`.\\n\\nMonitor a print job\\nYou can monitor the job you sent to the printer (eg. ps432-3208) with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.\\nLpq will return the following output:\\n\\n[herzog 33] lpq -Pps432-3208\\nPrinter: ps432-3208@lpr1 (dest raw@ps432-3208.umiacs.umd.edu) \\'HP M653 in IRB 3208\\'\\nQueue: 2 printable jobs\\nServer: pid 11833 active\\nUnspooler: pid 11837 active\\nStatus: waiting for subserver to exit at 14:50:45.141\\nRank   Owner/ID                  Class Job Files                 Size Time\\nactive username@herzog+198           A   198 file.ps               4309 14:50:44\\n2      username2@prime+199           A   199 hpss.ps               4309 14:50:45\\nActive connection from  128.8.120.247\\nWaiting connection from 128.8.120.247\\n\\nRemove a Print Job\\nIf you would like to remove your job from the queue, you should get the job\\'s id from the output of `lpq`. You can remove it with `lprm -Pps432-3208 198`\\nFrom the output of lpq, I can see that the job id is 198 and I can remove it with lprm as follows:\\n\\n[herzog 35] lprm -Pps432-3208 198\\nPrinter ps432-3208@durer:\\nchecking perms \\'username@herzog+198\\'\\ndequeued \\'username@herzog+198\\'\\n\\nOften the last job listed in the printer queue has already spooled to the printer, and lprm will be unable to delete the job.  In this case, the only way to cancel the job will be to press the \\'cancel\\' button on the printer.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=UNIXPrinting&oldid=9829\"',\n",

       " 'VS Code\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nVisual Studio (VS) Code is a multi-platform source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be used with a variety of programming languages and can have its base functionality extended through extensions available via its marketplace. The base editor itself is free, but some extensions may require paid subscriptions.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Cluster Usage\\n\\n1.1 Best Practices\\n\\n1.1.1 Use only as a code editor\\n1.1.2 Do not open large files\\n1.1.3 Clean up when done\\n\\n2 Common Issues\\n\\n\\nCluster Usage\\nIt can be convenient when using our SLURM computing clusters to open a connection to a VS Code Server session on the submission node(s) that you have access to via VS Code\\'s Remote - SSH extension. Steps to set this up can be found here. Use your UMIACS username and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the submission node you want to connect to. Password authentication does not provide an option to save your password, so for convenience, you may want to set up an  SSH key.\\nFor a list of active issues with the Remote - SSH extension, please see Microsoft\\'s GitHub tracker here.\\n\\nBest Practices\\nBecause of the multi-tenant nature of our submission nodes, using the Remote - SSH extension to connect to a VS Code Server running on a submission node can have adverse affects on other users simultaneously using the submission nodes if not properly managed. The following is a list of \"best practices\" that we ask you please follow to minimize the chance of impacting others on submission nodes. We have compiled the list through observation as well as through discussion with users.\\n\\nUse only as a code editor\\nVS Code can perform many common file management operations, such as moving, copying, or deleting files or directories. However, the overhead of providing progress updates / status messages through VS Code\\'s UI can cause load spikes that result in other processes on the submission node (both system-level and other users\\') slowing down. This is especially the case if operating on thousands to millions of small image or video files. In extreme cases, it can seem as though the submission node is wholly unresponsive.\\nThe best way to combat this is to use VS Code as just a code editor as strictly as you can (meaning creating new and/or editing existing source code files only). Use standard command-line programs such as mv/cp/rm in VS Code\\'s terminal window or a separate application\\'s terminal window for local file management instead, or use the techniques advertised  here for larger data transfers between nodes.\\n\\nDo not open large files\\nFiles that you open in VS Code\\'s text editor on a remote machine through the Remote - SSH extension are loaded entirely into RAM on the remote machine. Because of the persistence of VS Code Server processes, opening several unique files may result in them all remaining in RAM for extended periods of time even if you no longer have tabs open for them in the Tab Bar.\\nAs such, please refrain from opening large files (more than a few MB) in VS Code itself on submission nodes. Either use a lighter-weight command-line based text editor such as vim or otherwise on the submission node itself, or first  transfer the files that you would like to open to either a less-used remote machine or your local machine before opening them.\\nIf you absolutely need to open one or more large files for a very brief period of time on a submission node, please clean up your server session on that node (see below section) as soon as possible when done.\\n\\nClean up when done\\nIf you are done using VS Code for an extended period of time (several hours / overnight), consider manually killing your server session on the submission node when exiting. By default, VS Code Server will keep the processes used by your session active for a few hours after you disconnect, keeping the VS Code Server processes on the submission node you were using alive, despite no longer actively being used.\\nThis can be done by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching \"Kill VS Code Server on Host...\".\\n\\n\\nSelect the submission node you were using and click on it.\\n\\n\\nWait a few seconds and you should get a message confirming the command went through.\\n\\n\\nThe next time you connect to the same submission node, you will have a fresh VS Code session on it.\\n\\nCommon Issues\\nIf you are having trouble SSH\\'ing to a submission node with VS Code, check if your home directory is full.\\n\\nConnect to one of your Nexus submission nodes via SSH not using VS Code.\\n Remote connect to a server\\n\\n\\nNavigate to your home directory. cd ~\\n\\n\\nCheck if it is full. df -h .\\n\\n\\nIf it is full (Avail 0), delete some files to free up at least ~100MB of space.

Some things that are publicly accessible are still under copyright and it is important to understand what the restrictions are on any data that you crawl from remotely accessible sites.\\nThere are a number of different organizations that still give access to academic institutions (such as UMIACS) through IP based filtering, but have restrictions on crawling.  The services that they provide may also not be adequately built for programmatic crawling.  In this case, these organizations may ban IP addresses or ranges if crawling is observed on those IP addresses or ranges.  This can then prevent other individuals from using these services from the same IP addresses or ranges. In the case of UMIACS, bad behavior on the part of a single user from UMIACS systems can result in all access to a service being banned from UMIACS\\' public IP addresses.\\nSome examples of databases or sites that may have restrictions on crawling are (not an exhaustive list):\\n\\nUniversity of Maryland Library Resources - https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=326950&p=2194463\\nNCBI - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/\\n\\n\\nYou should never try to evade limitations or restrictions imposed by the site or owner for publicly available service that you are looking to crawl.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=WebCrawling&oldid=11648\"',\n",

Such information is encrypted in memory upon receipt and sent to a designated email address, the owner of which will decrypt it using a email encryption/decryption program.\\nThe recommended email encryption/decryption software at UMIACS is WinPT (Windows Privacy Tray), a small and powerful software from http://winpt.wald.intevation.org/. It is freely available to all users. It must be noted that you need GnuPG 1.4.11 or higher installed on your computer to use WinPT. You can download GnuPG for free from the GnuPG website.\\n\\nWinPT Instructions\\nThe first time you run this program, you will be asked to generate your \"keypair\". A keypair contains a public key, which is usually used for encryption, and a private key, which is used for decryption.\\nNow you are ready to encrypt and decrypt messages. To do so: \\n\\nSimply copy the text you wish to encrypt/decrypt into the Windows clipboard (i.e., use \"copy\" or \"ctrl-v\")\\nClick on the WinPT icon in the lower-right corner of the screen\\nSelect the approriate menu item\\nFollow the on-screen prompts.\\n\\n\\nTo have others send you encrypted messages, you must give them your public key. To do so:\\nexport your public key (There are three different ways to do this, reference this manual to decide which is best for you.), and send it to the other side. Never distribute your private key.\\nIn the case of the standard UMIACS setup for accepting sensitive information online, such as credit card information, social security number, etc, it is mandatory that we use encrypted messages. Send your public key to webmaster@umiacs.umd.edu and clearly indicate which online form this is for.\\n\\nExtra Links\\nFor an even more in-depth guide, consult this over-simplified WinPT Tutorial.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=WebSensitiveInformation&oldid=6209\"',\n",

To simplify the user experience we will be consolidating authentication into a single new Active Directory domain (UMIACS).  At the end of the consolidation, you will be able to use a single password for all UMIACS services.\\nTo prepare for this change, UMIACS staff need to migrate all UMIACS Windows accounts to a new domain. This migration starts by moving your account from our existing Windows Active Directory domain (PC\\\\username) to a new one (UMIACS\\\\username). After this migration is completed we will follow up with an announcement detailing the final steps of the password consolidation process.\\nNo files or emails will be lost as part of this migration.\\u200b\\n\\nActions you need to take\\nLog off your Windows workstation (if you have one) prior to 8am on Saturday, March 24th, otherwise you will be forcibly logged out at this time.\\n\\n\\nService impact during this Migration\\nYour password will NOT change.\\nAuthentication to the Pulse Secure VPN will not be available during this migration window. Existing sessions will not be terminated, allowing you to continue using the VPN through the migration.  Two days prior to the migration, we will extend the default VPN session limit to 48 hours in order to minimize your disruption. If you require the VPN during this time please make sure you authenticate and maintain your connection before the outage window starts.\\nWindows workstations will be unavailable to log into during this migration window.\\nExchange email access will be interrupted during this migration window.  Exchange email will be delivered however will not be accessible from phones, Outlook, or Outlook Web Access until after the migration has concluded.\\n\\n\\nAfter the migration has completed\\nWe will post an announcement on https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu when the migration has completed and will also send a follow-up email.\\nYour Windows account format will change from PC\\\\username to UMIACS\\\\username where you are required to specify a domain. You must use this username format going forward. Services that will require this new format:\\nOutlook Web Access for Exchange email users\\nPhone email setup for Exchange email users\\nRemote Desktop workstation access\\nSaved network drive credentials, which can be updated via Credential Manager\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Windows_Account_Migration_March_2018&oldid=9331\"',\n",
       " 'Windows Activation\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nWindows Licensing\\nWindows uses an activation model for each UMD-licensed install. The installs will have to verify activation every 180 days. Activation and renewal is performed via the campus Key Management Server KMS, which is not available from off campus. For onsite desktops, this is not a problem. However, for laptops or home machines it poses a complication. As long as the laptop or home machine is periodically on the campus wireless or connects to the UMIACS or campus VPN, renewal activation will be performed automatically.\\nYou must only use the below procedure on University owned hardware.\\nPlease follow the below steps if you are receiving a message that your license is going to expire soon or that Windows is not activated.\\n\\nActivation\\nPlease note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN, or the  UMIACS VPN to activate. The below steps assume you have already established a network connection. Please also note that your time must be correct (i.e. set via the Internet) and set to the US Eastern timezone for this to work. You can try running w32tm /resync on the command line below in step 4 before running the other commands listed in that step to resync your time if the commands fail at first.\\n\\nClick on the Start menu and type \"cmd\" in the run bar.\\n\\nRight-Click on the cmd button, and select \"Run as Administrator\" - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!\\n\\nSelect \"Yes\" if you get a prompt to allow the following program to make changes.\\n\\nFrom the Command Prompt, run these commands in order:\\nWindows 10/11:cscript c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\slmgr.vbs -skms kms.umd.edu:1688\\ncscript c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\slmgr.vbs -ipk NPPR9-FWDCX-D2C8J-H872K-2YT43\\ncscript c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\slmgr.vbs -ato\\n\\nAfter these commands have run, the Key Management Server should have activated your Windows computer. You can also run: cscript c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\slmgr.vbs -xpr\\n\\n to see when the current activation expires.\\n\\nIf you are unable to activate, please see the message at the top of this section.

       " 'Windows Patch Management\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nIn order to combat the ever increasing number of third-party security vulnerabilities on Windows machines, UMIACS staff has deployed Ivanti Endpoint Manager. As security threats have evolved from the operating system to applications we have had to take this step in order to maintain operational security for the Institute. Currently the updates are focused on applications that are exposed to the internet such as web browsers, teleconferencing solutions, Adobe Flash, Java, etc.\\nThe Ivanti Endpoint Manager agent software is currently deployed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as  Enterprise supported Windows laptops and home machines.\\n\\nAutomated Scanning\\nPatches are deployed during the week leading up to the maintenance window. Specifically, they will always be released on the Wednesday that falls between the 9th and the 15th of every month, and typically in the morning.\\n\\nDesktops will scan for updates to be installed every night sometime between 7pm and 9pm. If you are not logged in during those times, the system will automatically install the patches and reboot if necessary. If you remain active on your system during those times, you will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.\\nLaptops will scan for updates to be installed at least once every day (assuming the laptop is powered on). This will only occur when the laptop has an active Internet connection (wired or wireless). You will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.\\n\\n\\nInstallation can be deferred until lock/logoff if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, installation will automatically proceed:\\n\\nDesktops: 24 hours\\nLaptops: 3 hours\\n\\n\\nIf a reboot is required after installation finishes, you will receive another pop up. It is highly suggested to reboot right away due to system instability and vulnerability. However, reboot can be deferred for up to 6 days if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, the machine will automatically reboot:\\n\\nDesktops: 24 hours\\nLaptops: 9 hours\\n\\n\\nIf you interrupt the installation process between when the first patch begins installing and when the last patch finishes installing, Ivanti may ask to reboot before continuing to install the remaining patches next time it pops up. This is by design. If you would like to avoid multiple reboots on a machine that is used intermittently (such as a laptop), we would recommend starting a manual scan just before you stop using the machine for the night and then letting the machine download and apply all patches overnight. See below section for how to do this.\\n\\nManual Scanning\\nThis should only need to be done on laptops or home machines in the event that Ivanti has not had a large enough time window to scan your computer recently, but can be optionally done if you see fit. Please note you will need an active Internet connection for this to work, however you do not need to be on the UMIACS VPN.\\n\\nSearch for \"Security Scan\" from the Start menu and click the result that shows up (should show a shield icon). The scan will begin. Patches will be detected and downloaded.\\nNote: The scan may fail on the \"Checking for other running scanners\" step if Ivanti is already running an invisible scan in the background. If this occurs, wait 10-15 minutes and then retry the scan.\\n\\nAfter all patches have been downloaded, you will be prompted to allow the install to begin.\\n\\nAfter all patches have been installed, you may be prompted to reboot.\\n\\nIf you do not want to reboot immediately, you can click on the \\'Remind me in:\\' drop down menu and click \\'More options...\\'\\n\\nClick the \\'Remind me on\\' radio button and choose a date and time before the deadline (it will tell you what the deadline is). Then click \\'Remind me later\\'.\\n\\nAfter reboot, run another scan and verify no patches are detected. If a patch is continually failing, please  contact staff.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Windows_Patch_Management&oldid=12065\"',\n",

These accounts can access resources such as GitLab, UMobjstore, Wikis, and other web-based applications. These accounts do not have storage and access to UMIACS workstations, however.\\n\\nHow do I create a Collaborator Account?\\nA UMIACS Account holder has to sponsor the Collaborator Account.   This is done in our UMIACS Requests Application.  This will send an email to the Collaborator to set their details (including a username and password).  Once the Collaborator has created their account, an email will be sent to both the account sponsor and the Collaborator that the account is ready to use.\\n\\nServices Offered\\nCollaborators can access GitLab, the Object Store, as well as other web applications.\\n\\nGitLab\\nGitLab is a source code collaboration software based on Git source control management.  It supports built-in project wikis, code review, and issue tracking for each project.  All Collaborators automatically get GitLab access.  Although Collaborators can modify any of the repos you add them to, they do not get an allocation to create projects of their own.\\n\\nObject Store\\nUMobjstore is the web application component complementing UMobj, the command-line utility used to interact with the Object Store. UMobjstore gives users a convenient interface to our Ceph Object Stores which are distributed across different machines, so that machines can fail and the cluster keep functioning.\\n\\nWikis\\nWikis are great for providing collaborative web spaces. In order to access a particular wiki, a Collaborator will first have to be added to the respective SecGroup.\\n\\nControlling Access to your Collaborators\\nSecurity Groups\\nSecGroup are authentication groups that give PIs the ability to manage which users should have access to different applications that they manage.  They provide fine-grained access control to wikis, source code repositories, and certain web applications.\\n\\nViewing Security Groups\\nYou can view which SecGroups you can grant access to through the directory app: https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Working_with_External_Collaborators&oldid=7984\"']"

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Apptainer.html'}, page_content='Apptainer\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nApptainer is a container platform that doesn\\'t elevate the privileges of a user running the container.  This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus) and doesn\\'t provide administrative control to users on them.  While Docker is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.\\nApptainer was previously branded as Singularity.  You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity, however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Overview\\n2 Nexus Containers\\n\\n2.1 Bind Mounts\\n2.2 Shared Containers\\n\\n\\n3 Docker Workflow Example\\n\\n\\nOverview\\nYou can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command.  If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please  contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on.\\n\\n# apptainer --version\\napptainer version 1.2.5-1.el8\\n\\nApptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images.  To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.\\nIf you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories.  We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like.\\n\\nexport WORKDIR=/scratch0/$USER\\nexport APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${WORKDIR}/.cache\\nexport APPTAINER_TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/.tmp\\nmkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR\\nmkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIR\\n\\nWe do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file (SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image.\\n\\n$ apptainer pull cuda12.2.2.sif docker://nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8\\nINFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format\\nINFO:    Starting build...\\nGetting image source signatures\\nCopying blob d5d706ce7b29 done\\nCopying blob b4dc78aeafca done\\nCopying blob 24a22c1b7260 done\\nCopying blob 8dea37be3176 done\\nCopying blob 25fa05cd42bd done\\nCopying blob a57130ec8de1 done\\nCopying blob 880a66924cf5 done\\nCopying config db554d658b done\\nWriting manifest to image destination\\nStoring signatures\\n2022/10/14 10:31:17  info unpack layer: sha256:25fa05cd42bd8fabb25d2a6f3f8c9f7ab34637903d00fd2ed1c1d0fa980427dd\\n2022/10/14 10:31:19  info unpack layer: sha256:24a22c1b72605a4dbcec13b743ef60a6cbb43185fe46fd8a35941f9af7c11153\\n2022/10/14 10:31:19  info unpack layer: sha256:8dea37be3176a88fae41c265562d5fb438d9281c356dcb4edeaa51451dbdfdb2\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:b4dc78aeafca6321025300e9d3050c5ba3fb2ac743ae547c6e1efa3f9284ce0b\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:a57130ec8de1e44163e965620d5aed2abe6cddf48b48272964bfd8bca101df38\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:d5d706ce7b293ffb369d3bf0e3f58f959977903b82eb26433fe58645f79b778b\\n2022/10/14 10:31:49  info unpack layer: sha256:880a66924cf5e11df601a4f531f3741c6867a3e05238bc9b7cebb2a68d479204\\nINFO:    Creating SIF file...\\n\\n$ apptainer inspect cuda12.2.2.sif\\n...\\nmaintainer: NVIDIA CORPORATION <sw-cuda-installer@nvidia.com>\\nname: ubi8\\norg.label-schema.build-arch: amd64\\norg.label-schema.build-date: Wednesday_24_January_2024_13:53:0_EST\\norg.label-schema.schema-version: 1.0\\norg.label-schema.usage.apptainer.version: 1.2.5-1.el8\\norg.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.bootstrap: docker\\norg.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.from: nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8\\n...\\n\\nNow you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command.  \\n\\nPlease note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag.

Apptainer containers will not automatically mount data from the outside operating system other than your home directory.  Users need to manually bind mounts for other file paths.\\n--bind /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>/<PROJECTNAME>:/mnt\\nIn this example, we will exec an interactive session with GPUs and binding our Nexus scratch directory which allows us to specify the command we want to run inside the container.\\n\\napptainer exec --nv --bind /fs/nexus-scratch/username:/fs/nexus-scratch/username /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch/pytorch_1.13.0+cu117.sif bash\\n\\nYou can now write/run your own pytorch python code interactively within the container or just make a python script that you can call directly from the apptainer exec command for batch processing.\\n\\n\\nShared Containers\\nPortable images called Singularity Image Format or .sif files can be copied and shared.  Nexus maintains some shared containers in /fs/nexus-containers.  These are arranged by the application(s) that are installed.\\n\\nDocker Workflow Example\\nWe have a pytorch_docker example workflow using our GitLab as a Docker registry.  You can clone the repository and further customize this to your needs. The workflow is:\\n\\nRun Docker on a laptop or personal desktop on to create the image, or use Podman on a UMIACS-supported system.\\nTag the image and and push it to your repository (this can be any docker registry)\\nPull the image down onto one of our workstations/clusters and run it with your data.\\n\\n\\n$ apptainer pull pytorch_docker.sif docker://registry.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker\\nINFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format\\nINFO:    Starting build...\\nGetting image source signatures\\nCopying blob 85386706b020 done\\n...\\n2022/10/14 10:58:36  info unpack layer: sha256:b6f46848806c8750a68edc4463bf146ed6c3c4af18f5d3f23281dcdfb1c65055\\n2022/10/14 10:58:43  info unpack layer: sha256:44845dc671f759820baac0376198141ca683f554bb16a177a3cfe262c9e368ff\\nINFO:    Creating SIF file...\\n\\n$ apptainer exec --nv pytorch_docker.sif python3 -c \\'from __future__ import print_function; import torch; print(torch.cuda.current_device()); x = torch.rand(5, 3); print(x)\\'\\n0\\ntensor([[0.3273, 0.7174, 0.3587],\\n        [0.2250, 0.3896, 0.4136],\\n        [0.3626, 0.0383, 0.6274],\\n        [0.6241, 0.8079, 0.2950],\\n        [0.0804, 0.9705, 0.0030]])\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Apptainer&oldid=11997\"'),\n",

Subsequently you will receive every day (unless you configure otherwise) a mail at approx. 3:30pm EST from the Barracuda with your quarantine summary. Please note that auto log-in through the link provided in the summary does not work due to a recent firmware upgrade on the Barracudas. Please use the links provided above to log in.\\n\\n\\nScoring\\nThe Barracudas will score every message that passes through them and inject varying message headers based on that score.  You can then create email filters based on these headers to filter out messages that are tagged as spam by the Barracudas. See BarracudaSpamFirewall/Scoring for more details.\\n\\nQuarantine\\nMail that has been deemed as spam will be kept on the Barracudas in quarantine.  It will not be delivered to your mailbox unless you configure the Barracudas to do so.\\nYour quarantine will be preserved for 21 days. If mail is held for longer, then it will be purged.\\nIf you receive a security warning in your browser after clicking this link, you may need to add the UMIACS Certificate Authority\\n\\n\\nYou can search your spam quarantine with the following steps BarracudaSpamFirewall/SearchingQuarantine\\n\\n\\nQuarantine Passthrough\\nIf you wish to have the mail that would ordinarily be quarantined by Barracuda delivered to your mailbox instead you can configure this using the Barracuda web configuration.\\nYou can enable this functionality with the following guide BarracudaSpamFirewall/QuarantinePassthrough\\n\\n\\nWhitelists, Blacklists & Bayesian Filtering\\nYou may also setup whitelists, blacklists, and Bayesian filtering options through the Preferences tab at the top of the Barracuda web portal.\\n\\n\\nMore Information\\nFor more information on how to use the Barracuda please download the user\\'s guide:\\n\\n\\nhttps://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/images/5/5a/Barracuda_usersguide.pdf\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BarracudaSpamFirewall&oldid=10019\"'),\n",

Having BitLocker integrated with the operating system addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.\\nData on a lost or stolen computer is vulnerable to unauthorized access, either by running a software-attack tool against it or by transferring the computer\\'s hard disk to a different computer. BitLocker helps mitigate unauthorized data access by enhancing file and system protections. BitLocker also helps render data inaccessible when BitLocker-protected computers are decommissioned or recycled.\\nOfficial Microsoft documentation can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview\\n\\nBitLocker at UMIACS\\nAll of our supported personal office workstations as well all  enterprise or base-supported laptops and home machines will have BitLocker enabled by UMIACS staff as part of each machine\\'s install process.\\n\\nRecovery Key Prompts\\nOrdinarily, no interaction should be required with BitLocker to keep it in a functional state. However, a few circumstances may lead to BitLocker detecting changes to the system boot information and prevent the computer from reaching Windows. This is by design.\\n\\nSome factors that may cause this (not exhaustive):\\n\\nBIOS or firmware updates -- some manufacturer automatic driver update utilities include these by default - beware!\\nDVDs or USB drives inserted or plugged in during boot\\nMalware on the system\\n\\n\\nThe first step should always be to disconnect any external devices and then power the machine off and back on. This ensures that the hardware configuration of the machine is the same as it was when UMIACS staff initially enabled BitLocker. If the prompt still pops up, please contact UMIACS staff for further troubleshooting.\\n\\nTemporarily Suspending Bitlocker\\nIn the event that you encounter the recovery screen above, after booting back into Windows, follow these steps to ensure the prompt does not appear on subsequent reboots. The first two steps can also be taken proactively if you know you will be making a change that affects BitLocker. (see above)\\n\\nSearch for BitLocker in the Start menu and click on \"Manage BitLocker\".\\n\\nClick \"Suspend protection\" on the Operating system drive and hit yes to the confirmation prompt.\\n\\nIf you are doing something to the computer that would ordinarily trigger BitLocker recovery, perform that operation now. Then after you boot back into Windows, click \"Resume protection\".\\n\\nBitLocker will resume and commit the current boot configuration.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BitLocker&oldid=11219\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'name': 'BitLocker_PersonalUse.html'}, page_content='BitLocker/PersonalUse\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nContents\\n\\n1 Overview\\n2 Prerequisites\\n3 Initializing the YubiKey and hard drive\\n4 Unlocking the drive\\n\\n4.1 Unlocking the drive with the YubiKey\\n4.2 Unlocking the drive with the recovery password\\n\\n\\n5 Extra configuration\\n\\n5.1 Set up Auto-unlock\\n5.2 Use an encrypted drive as a backup drive\\n\\nOverview\\nBitLocker can be used on fixed hard drives (i.e. internal to your computer) as well as on portable hard drives (i.e. USB). If you want to hold a secure, offline copy of files that you want to be preserved, BitLocker To Go with a portable hard drive with data to be stored and a hardware token as the key can be used together to do so.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\nA portable hard drive formatted with an NTFS (preferred), FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT file system.\\nAny desktop edition of Windows 10/11 except Home. BitLocker encryption is not included as a feature of Windows 10/11 Home, though encrypted drives can still be accessed via Windows 10/11 Home.\\nA YubiKey security token. Other security tokens may work, but this procedure will focus on using a YubiKey.\\n(optional) One or more (2+ strongly preferred) blank USB flash drives at least 500MB in size, formatted with any Windows-writable file system.\\n\\n\\nInitializing the YubiKey and hard drive\\nLog in locally to the machine you wish to use for encryption. This procedure will not work over Remote Desktop.\\nDownload and install the YubiKey personalization tool. Choose the first option (not the command line interface version). If you are using a UMIACS-supported workstation, please contact  UMIACS Staff to install this on your machine.\\nInsert your YubiKey into any USB slot on the machine you wish to use for encryption and launch the personalization tool. Select Static Password at the top and then Advanced.\\n\\nSelect Configuration Slot 2(*) and change the password length to 48 chars. Then click all three Generate buttons in order to generate the identities and the secret key and finally Write Configuration. Click cancel (do not save) on the prompt that pops up to save the .csv file, as this saves the Public Identity, Private Identity, and Secret Key in plaintext. Ensure that \"YubiKey has been successfully configured\" is output in the Results window, and then click Exit in the top right to exit the tool.\\n(*) NOTE: The YubiKey token has two configuration slots. These are nearly functionally identical, but the key difference for the sake of this document is that Slot 2 requires you to hold the sensor on the device down for 2 seconds in order to activate, whereas Slot 1 instantaneously activates when you touch the sensor. We recommend using Slot 2 so that you do not mistakenly emit the password configured below. If you are already using Slot 2 on your YubiKey, slot 1 can still be used.\\n\\nInsert your portable hard drive into any USB slot and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.\\n\\nExpand Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go by clicking the arrow on the right and then click Turn on BitLocker on the portable hard drive.\\n\\nBitLocker will initialize for a few seconds and then pop up with a menu asking how you want to unlock the drive. Choose Use a password to unlock the drive and physically touch the YubiKey\\'s sensor for 3 seconds to get it to output the password you configured previously in each password field.\\n\\nThe menu should automatically advance to asking how you want to back up the recovery key. The recovery key is the only way to get into the encrypted drive if you lose the YubiKey. We strongly recommend the Save to a file option for reasons that we will get into. If you choose to print out the recovery key, store it somewhere safe such as a safe deposit box.\\n\\nPlug in your first USB flash drive and choose to save the file on it.\\n\\nIf you previously had anything saved on your portable hard drive before formatting it as part of the prerequisites, choose to Encrypt entire drive. This is the safest way to ensure everything on the drive is protected. Otherwise (if this is a brand new blank drive), leave the default option of Encrypt used disk space only.\\n\\nLeave the default of Compatible mode to better ensure the files on the encrypted drive will be readable from other devices (which may be running earlier versions of Windows) if need be.\\n\\nContinue through the menus and finally choose to Start encrypting.\\n\\nBitLocker will begin encrypting and a separate window will pop up to show you the status. This step will either take a long time if you chose to Encrypt entire drive, or complete very quickly if you chose to Encrypt used disk space only. You do not have to wait for encryption to complete to proceed with the remaining steps, but you do need to wait for encryption to complete before disconnecting the portable hard drive from the machine.\\n\\nDownload the portable version of KeePassXC Password Manager. Then extract it to your USB flash drive.\\n\\nLaunch KeePassXC.exe from the extracted folder and choose to Create new database.\\n\\nChoose descriptive phrases for the Database Name and Description and click Continue.\\n\\nLeave all the options on the next menu at default unless you know what you are doing and have good reason to change them and click Continue.\\n\\nChoose a memorable password and click Done.\\n\\nChoose to save the file on your USB flash drive.\\n\\nIn your newly created database, choose to Add a new entry from the top pane.\\n\\nMake the Title something memorable. Open the recovery key text file saved earlier, copy the Identifier into the Username field and the Recovery Key into the Password/Repeat fields. Leave some descriptive text in the Notes section to help clarify which fields are which of the BitLocker attributes. Click OK and then exit out of the database back on the main menu.\\n\\nDelete the recovery key text file permanently (NOT the database file you just created). If you leave the recovery key text file on the USB drive, your encrypted portable hard drive is only as secure as that USB flash drive is, rather than needing both the USB flash drive and the password for the database to access the recovery key.\\n\\n(Optional) Copy the contents of the first USB flash drive onto one or more additional USB flash drives to safeguard against loss of both the YubiKey and any single USB flash drive.\\nClearly label the USB flash drive(s) and store them somewhere secure, such as a safe deposit box. If you have multiple USB flash drives, store them separately.\\nYour portable hard drive is now securely BitLocker-encrypted, with one or more USB drives serving as access to the recovery key.\\n\\n\\nUnlocking the drive\\nUnlocking the drive with the YubiKey\\nTo later unlock the drive from the same or a different computer:\\n\\nPhysically plug the drive and YubiKey in. Click on the notification you get in the notification area, which will open the unlock menu.\\n\\nPhysically touch the YubiKey\\'s sensor for 3 seconds to get it to emit the password. It will automatically unlock afterwards.\\n\\nThe drive is now unlocked until it is unplugged again.\\n\\n\\nUnlocking the drive with the recovery password\\nTo later unlock the drive from the same or a different computer if you are not in possession of your YubiKey:\\n\\nPhysically plug one of your USB flash drives containing a database with the recovery key in.\\nOpen the recovery database using the password you set for it and then copy the password for the entry inside of it. This is the recovery key.\\n\\nPhysically plug the drive in. Click on the notification you get in the notification area, which will open the unlock menu.\\n\\nClick on More options and then Enter recovery key.\\n\\nEnter the copied recovery key from your database file and click Unlock.\\n\\nThe drive is now unlocked until it is unplugged again. If you have lost your YubiKey, we strongly recommend buying a new YubiKey, decrypting BitLocker on the drive, and then repeating the initial procedure to re-encrypt it with the new YubiKey.\\n\\n\\nExtra configuration\\nSet up Auto-unlock\\nBitLocker has the ability to auto-unlock an encrypted drive for a specific user(s) when plugged into a specific computer(s) if so desired. This creates an entry in the Windows registry on each computer\\'s local data storage for each user you turn it on for. The entry stores a copy of the volume master key for the encrypted drive that is itself encrypted with a combination of the user\\'s username and either the user\\'s password, if there is one, or computer credentials.\\nWe do not recommend turning this on as it undermines the concept of separation of the unlock methods for the drive from any specific computer. If you do want to turn this on, please ensure the user account(s) that you turn it on for are secure (i.e. have sufficiently complex passwords) and the computer(s) that you turn it on for are in secure locations.\\nTo enable auto-unlock for a drive (per user per computer):\\n\\nInsert your already-encrypted portable hard drive into any USB slot, unlock it, and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.\\n\\nExpand Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go by clicking the arrow on the right and then click Turn on auto-unlock on the portable hard drive.\\n\\nThe drive will now auto-unlock when plugged into the computer you are currently on for your user account only. You can turn it off again by clicking on the Turn off auto-unlock option that appears in the same location after clicking the turn on button.\\n\\n\\nUse an encrypted drive as a backup drive\\nOne of the more useful things you may want to do with a BitLocker-encrypted portable hard drive is set up automatic backup to it. This can be done by following the procedure on  this page, though please note you will need to unlock the drive each time when plugging it into a computer, or have configured auto-unlock for that computer, before it is accessible by backup software.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BitLocker/PersonalUse&oldid=10837\"'),\n",

Faculty may request that a class be supported by following the instructions  here.\\n\\nGetting an account\\nYour TA or instructor will request an account for you. Once this is done, you will be notified by email that you have an account to redeem.  If you have not received an email, please contact your TA or instructor. You must redeem the account within 7 days or else the redemption token will expire.  If your redemption token does expire, please contact your TA or instructor to have it renewed.\\nOnce you do redeem your account, you will need to wait until you get a confirmation email that your account has been installed.  This is typically done once a day on days that the University is open for business.\\nAny questions or issues with your account, storage, or cluster use must first be made through your TA or instructor.\\n\\nRegistering for Duo\\nUMIACS requires that all Class accounts register for MFA (multi-factor authentication) under our Duo instance (note that this is different than UMD\\'s general Duo instance). You will not be able to log onto the class submission host until you register.\\nIf you see the following error in your SSH client, you have not yet enrolled/registered in Duo.\\n\\nAccess is not allowed because you are not enrolled in Duo. Please contact your organization\\'s IT help desk.\\n\\nIn order to register, visit our directory app and log in with your Class username and password. You will then receive a prompt to enroll in Duo. For assistance in enrollment, please visit our  Duo help page.\\nOnce notified that your account has been installed and you have registered in our Duo instance, you can SSH to nexusclass.umiacs.umd.edu with your assigned username and your chosen password to log in to a submission host.\\nIf you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:\\n\\nnexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nnexusclass01.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\n\\nCleaning up your account before the end of the semester\\nClass accounts for a given semester are liable to be archived and deleted after that semester\\'s completion as early as the following:\\n\\nWinter semesters: February 1st of same year\\nSpring semesters: June 1st of same year\\nSummer semesters: September 1st of same year\\nFall semesters: January 1st of next year\\n\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure you have backed up anything you want to keep from your class account\\'s personal or group storage (below sections) prior to the relevant date.\\n\\nPersonal Storage\\nYour home directory has a quota of 30GB and is located at:\\n\\n/fs/classhomes/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>\\n\\nwhere <semester> is either \"spring\", \"summer\", \"fall\", or \"winter\", <year> is the current year e.g., \"2021\",  <coursecode> is the class\\' course code as listed in UMD\\'s Schedule of Classes in all lowercase e.g., \"cmsc999z\", and <username> is the username mentioned in the email you received to redeem the account e.g., \"c999z000\".\\nYou can request up to another 100GB of personal storage if you would like by having your TA or instructor  contact staff. This storage will be located at\\n\\n/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>\\n\\nGroup Storage\\nYou can also request group storage by having your TA or instructor  contact staff to specify the usernames of the accounts that should be in the group. Only other class accounts in the same class can be added to the group. The quota will be 100GB multiplied by the number of accounts in the group and will be located at\\n\\n/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<groupname>\\n\\nwhere <groupname> is composed of:\\n\\nthe abbreviated course code as used in the username e.g., \"c999z\"\\nthe character \"g\"\\nthe number of the group (starting at 0 for the first group for the class requested to us) prepended with 0s to make the total group name 8 characters long\\n\\n\\ne.g., \"c999zg00\".\\n\\nCluster Usage\\nYou may not run computational jobs on any submission host.  You must  schedule your jobs with the SLURM workload manager.  You can also find out more with the public documentation for the SLURM Workload Manager.\\nClass accounts only have access to the following submission parameters in SLURM:\\n\\n--partition - class\\n--account - class\\n--qos - default, medium, and high\\n\\n\\nYou must specify at least the partition parameter manually in any submission command you run. If you do not specify any QoS parameter, you will receive the QoS default.\\nYou can view the resource limits for each QoS by running the command show_qos. The value in the MaxWall column is the maximum runtime you can run a single job for each QoS, and the values in the MaxTRES column are the maximum amount of CPU cores/GPUs/memory you can request for a single job using each QoS.\\nPlease note that you will be restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM across all jobs you have running at once. This can be viewed with the command show_partition_qos.\\n\\nExample\\nHere is a basic example to schedule a interactive job running bash with a single GPU in the partition class, with the account class, running with the QoS of default and the default CPU/memory allocation/time limit for the partition.\\n\\nbash-4.4$ hostname\\nnexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nbash-4.4$ srun --partition=class --account=class --qos=default --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash\\nsrun: Job time limit was unset; set to partition default of 60 minutes\\nsrun: job 1333337 queued and waiting for resources\\nsrun: job 1333337 has been allocated resources\\n\\nbash-4.4$ hostname\\ntron14.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nbash-4.4$ nvidia-smi -L\\nGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-55f2d3b7-9162-8b02-50de-476a012c626c)\\n\\nAvailable Nodes\\nYou can list the available nodes and their current state with the show_nodes -p class command.

Each class will need to have the faculty member or TA(s) as the point of contacts for the class.  All students within the class will need to raise issues or questions through these points of contact who can relay or request support through our HelpDesk.  Please refer to the ClassAccounts documentation for further information.\\n\\nRequest New Class\\nIf you are a faculty member teaching a class and want to use our resources, send email to staff@umiacs.umd.edu to create a ticket.  Please list or CC your TA(s) and what course you are teaching.  UMIACS staff will confirm the course through UMD Testudo and create the class within our Requests application.  We will associate you and your TA(s) with the class to be able to manage it through this application.  If your TAs do not have existing UMIACS accounts, please sponsor  collaborator accounts for each of them.\\nPlease also mention any special storage allocation(s) you may need in your request.\\nOnce the class is created, you and your TAs may want to create class accounts for yourselves (which is allowed).  This ensures you see the steps that students will see when getting their account(s) and give you the ability to test and manage any local resources for the class.\\n\\nManagement of Accounts\\nOnce the class is created, accounts go through the following lifecycle.\\n\\nFaculty/TAs create requests in our Requests application with the class dashboard.  This is done by entering a form with one or more email addresses.  We only support creating accounts for @umd.edu and @terpmail.umd.edu addresses.\\nOnce a request for a student has been created from this email address, the student receives an email with a URL including a token that is only good for 7 days. Once they click this URL, they will be taken to a page to redeem their account by entering some information about themselves and selecting a password for their account.\\nIf the student does not redeem their account, Faculty/TAs can go into the student\\'s class account request in the app and renew their token.  This will invalidate the old token and issue a new token and then send a new email for account redemption.\\n\\n\\nAccounts that are redeemed will show up as pending in the Accounts Installed section of the class dashboard.  UMIACS Technical Staff will install class accounts that have been redeemed once per business day.  Once the account(s) are installed, they will be listed as installed on the class dashboard.  Each student will receive an email with information on getting started with their class account.\\nNote that class accounts also need to setup Duo multi-factor authentication in order to access the cluster.  Otherwise, they will see the message Access is not allowed because you are not enrolled in Duo. Please contact your organization\\'s IT help desk. when trying to SSH to the class account login nodes.  Have them follow the instructions  here.\\nIf a student does not provide a phone number when they redeem their account, they will not be able to reset their password automatically in the event that they forget it.  In this case, the TA will need to  contact staff and staff will advise on the steps.\\n\\n\\nFaculty/TAs will need to communicate any special instructions or information with their students on how to use the computational resources.\\n\\n\\nDeletion of Class\\nWe will notify and clean up all class accounts after each major semester\\'s completion. Class accounts are liable to be archived and deleted as early as follows:\\n\\nWinter semesters: February 1st of same year\\nSpring semesters: June 1st of same year\\nSummer semesters: September 1st of same year\\nFall semesters: January 1st of next year\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=ClassAccounts/Manage&oldid=10785\"'),\n",

In the context of a cluster job, the data being processed, as well as any generated results, should be stored on a disk physically installed in the compute node itself.  We\\'ll cover how to identify local disk space later on this page.\\n\\nGeneral Workflow\\nThe following is a suggested workflow for a computational job:\\n\\nCopy the data to be processed to local disk space of the compute node(s) your job is assigned.\\nProcess the data, storing results on local disk space.\\nOnce processing is finished, transfer results to permanent storage location. (i.e., a network file share)\\nClean up data and results from local disk space of the compute node(s) your job is assigned.\\n\\n\\nWhy this matters\\nSimilar to how running too many processes on a single machine can slow it down, too many users accessing shares on a network file server can impact performance of that file server.  This issue is further compounded in the context of cluster jobs, as a single user can generate hundreds if not thousands of jobs all trying to access the same network file server.  By utilizing the local disks on the compute nodes, you effectively distribute the data access load and reduce the load on the file server.\\nFollowing these best practices isn\\'t just about being a good neighbor however, they will also improve the performance of your jobs.\\nTo further illustrate this issue, consider a service like Netflix.  While Netflix invests heavily in their data storage and supporting network, if they allowed their customers to access it directly it would quickly reach capacity resulting in performance degradation for all users.  In order to accommodate this, Netflix distributes its data into various caching tiers, which are much closer to the end user.  This distribution evens the load across multiple different devices, increasing the performance and availability for all users.\\nWhile UMIACS obviously does not operate at the same scale as Netflix, the same concepts are still present within the compute infrastructure.  Processing data that resides on local disk space reduces the load on the central file server and improves the performance of the process.\\n\\nData Storage\\nWhen possible, it is recommended that data be stored in an archive file when not actively being processed (i.e., before initiating inbound/outbound transfers to/from local disk space).\\nUtilizing archive files provide the following benefits:\\n\\nFaster data transfers\\nReduced data size\\nEasier data management\\n\\n\\nPractically every filesystem in existence has limitations in its ability to handle large numbers of small files.  By grouping large collections of small files into a single archive file, you can reduce the impact of this limitation, as well as improve the efficiency of data storage when combined with techniques such as compression.  Another advantage manifests when transferring data over the network.  In order to transfer a file, a connection to the remote location has to be established and closed for each file, which can add significant overhead when dealing with large numbers of files.  When the files are collected into a single archive file, you reduce the number of connections that are created and destroyed, and focus more on streaming data.  \\nCommon utilities for creating archive files are tar and zip.\\n\\nIdentifying Local Disk Space\\nLocal disk space at UMIACS typically conforms to the following guidelines:\\n\\nDirectory name starts with /scratch\\nAlmost every UMIACS supported machine has a /scratch0\\nMachines with multiple local disks may have multiple /scratchX directories, where X is a number that increases with the number of disks\\n\\n\\nExample, with output shortened for brevity:\\n\\n$ lsblk \\nNAME               MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\\nsda                  8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk\\n└─sda2               8:2    0 930.5G  0 part\\n  ├─vol00-scratch0 253:3    0   838G  0 lvm  /scratch0\\nsdb                  8:16   0   477G  0 disk\\n└─sdb1               8:17   0   477G  0 part /scratch1\\nsdc                  8:32   0 953.9G  0 disk\\n└─sdc1-scratch2    253:2    0 953.9G  0 lvm  /scratch2\\n\\nLocal disk space is considered transitory and as such is not backed up.  It is not intended for long-term storage of critical/sensitive data.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the available local disk space on a given cluster, please refer to the documentation specific for that cluster, or contact  the UMIACS Help Desk.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Compute/DataLocality&oldid=12074\"'),\n",

It is simple to set up and highly customizable. At UMIACS, it is the software we recommend to users looking to either record or stream on either their personal computers or in a conference room or auditorium setting.\\n\\nConference Quick Setup\\nBelow are steps outlining how to start recording or streaming your meetings. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk. \\n\\nSelect the source you\\'d like to route to the computer via the \"Shared Media\" option on the Crestron control panel. This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.\\nDownload (windows zip file) and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.\\nSet up video.\\nClick the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.\\nEnsure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called \\'AV Bridge\\'.\\nClick OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.\\nIf the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack\\'s default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.\\n\\n\\nEnsure audio settings look OK.\\nThe default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.\\nKeep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.\\n\\n\\nSet up either streaming, recording, or both as follows.\\n\\n\\nStreaming:\\n\\nGo to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).\\nLocate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this.\\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard, near the bottom\\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings, at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.\\n\\n\\nEnter your key and hit OK.\\nClick Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom.\\n\\n\\nRecording:\\n\\nGo to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive. We have observed that using external HDDs may introduce dropped frames due to encoding lag because of I/O bottlenecks.\\nClick Start Recording under the Control pane at the bottom.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=ConferenceRooms/Recording&oldid=10082\"'),\n",

You can copy data between the different types of data storage listed below, but it may be unnecessarily cumbersome if you don\\'t choose the right place for the \"master copy\" of your data.\\n\\n Local data storage is best suited for data that you are actively working on. Some examples are code that you are developing or using (perhaps to run computational jobs in SLURM with), results from computational jobs that have already run but have not yet been published in a paper, or files that need to be processed by another desktop-based or server-based application.\\nData on UMIACS\\' local storage can be moved between different UMIACS-supported hosts and shared with other  UMIACS account holders using common methods such as cp, File Explorer, Finder, and more.\\n\\n\\n UMIACS\\' Object Store is best suited for data that is going to remain static, but needs to remain accessible for very long periods of time, such as data referenced by published papers. It is also suitable for transferring specific versions of data in and out of UMIACS via large singular files, such as archive (tar/zip/etc.) files.\\nData in UMIACS\\' Object Store can be moved in and out of it, to local storage (whether UMIACS\\' or otherwise), via its web interface or one of many  compatible clients. Data can be shared publicly via simple download links or  static websites that can visualize the data in a more accessible way. UMIACS account holders can sponsor  Collaborator accounts for external collaborators that may need to upload and download new versions of data without needing direct access to UMIACS-supported hosts.\\n\\n\\n Cloud data storage is best suited for collaborative data, such as simple or rich text documents, PDF forms, spreadsheets, presentations, pictures, videos, and more. Many cloud storage service providers also provide web-based apps attached to their storage service that can be used to edit these types of data without ever having to download it to a specific device.\\nThe methods that can be used to move data in and out of cloud storage to local storage vary based on the specific service provider, but often involve web-based or mobile app-based upload and download. Data can be shared with others across the web via accounts associated with that service provider, and often publicly via simple download links.\\n\\n\\nHow can I transfer my data?\\nRclone\\nSCP\\nFTP\\nData Transfer\\n\\n\\nHow is my data retained?\\nSnapshots\\nNightlyBackups\\nArchives\\n\\n\\nWhat are some data storage best practices?\\nPublishing Data\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Data_Storage&oldid=12116\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Data_Transfer.html'}, page_content='Data Transfer\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nDepending on the amount of data you are trying to transfer there are different commands that you should use.  The classic cp command has a number of edge cases in which it will not copy everything that is expected, so the only time that one should use the cp command is if the copy can be verified, such as if you are moving a single file. The better choice for transferring data is by using tar or gtar.  After transferring files or directories, you can use rsync to check that everything moved correctly and to perform a final sync on changed files.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Transfer a single file\\n2 Transfer a directory or large amounts of data to another location\\n\\n2.1 Transfer between two different hosts\\n\\n\\n3 Verifying transfer\\n\\n\\nTransfer a single file\\nIf you want to transfer a single file into another directory you can use the cp command.  The format for the cp command is: cp Source Destination. If destination is omitted, it will make a copy of the file(s) in the current directory.\\n\\nTo copy the file foo.txt into your home directory\\'s Documents directory\\n\\n\\ncp foo.txt ~/Documents\\nTo transfer the file foo.txt from your current directory to another host use scp (secure copy) with <USERNAME>@<FQDN>:<PATH>\\n\\n\\nscp foo.txt USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/Documents\\nThis command will copy the file foo from your current directory to the folder Documents located in your home directory on the host example1. \\n\\nTo transfer back the file foo.txt from the host example1 to another directory in your current host\\n\\n\\nscp USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/Documents/foo.txt ~/Videos\\nImportant: The cp command should only be used for small file transfers.  If you try to transfer a large amount it is possible that cp will not copy all the files over properly. To learn more about the cp command type man cp on the in the terminal.\\n\\nTransfer a directory or large amounts of data to another location\\nIf you want to transfer a whole directory or a large amount of data to another location you can use the gtar command.\\n\\nTo combine two files in your current directory in an archive: gtar -cpvf archive.tar file1 file2\\n\\n\\nTo re-archive the data back in a different directory, for example Documents in your home directory: gtar -C ~/Documents/ -xpvf archive.tar\\n\\n\\nThis command will archive all files (including those in subdirectories) within the current directory and re-create the files in the directory that you specify.\\nThe format for the gtar command for data transfer is:\\n\\ngtar -cpf -  . | gtar -C /dir -xpvf -\\nIn this command, the target is a dash \\'-\\' which stands for standard output, and the source is a period \\'.\\' which is interpreted as all files in your current directory. The standard output is piped to the second command, which has as a source a dash \\'-\\' (which the shell interprets as standard input). The output of the first command is piped and becomes the input of the second command. The target directory in your second command is /dir. \\n\\nTo transfer all files from your documents to a folder in your home directory called foo: cd ~/Documents\\ngtar -cpf - . | gtar -C ~/foo -xpvf -\\n\\n\\nWhen you use this command it will display a list of the files it has transferred.\\nThis command will leave Documents the same, but create a full copy of all files and folders from Documents in foo.\\nNote: This command will preserve permissions, attributes, and meta-data of all files transferred.\\n\\nTransfer between two different hosts\\nTo transfer files from the tmp directory on example1.umiacs.umd.edu to the foo directory on your current host:\\n\\n\\nssh USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu gtar -cpf - /tmp | gtar -C /foo -xpvf -\\nTo transfer files from foo directory on your current host to the tmp directory on example1.umiacs.umd.edu:\\n\\n\\ngtar -cpf - /foo/ | ssh USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu gtar -C /tmp -xpvf -\\nIf your data transfer is interrupted, you can use the rsync command listed below to copy the rest of the files without creating doubles of files that have already been transferred.\\nrsync can also be used for the initial transfer of data if you expect the transfer to be interrupted.  Otherwise, this method should not be used as it takes more time and memory.\\nTo run rsync to copy files, the format for the command is the same as written below under \"Verifying transfer.\"\\n\\nVerifying transfer\\nTo verify that your transfer copied everything you can use the rsync command, which will compare the two directories\\' contents and will update the files in which it sees differences.\\nThe format for the rsync command is:\\n\\nrsync -aH /source/ /target\\nTo ensure that the files are the same in Documents and foo from the previous example:\\n\\nrsync -aH ~/Documents/ ~/foo\\nThis command will compare the files and directories within Documents to the files and directories within foo.  If there are files within Documents and its subdirectories that do not appear in foo, this command will copy the missing files from Documents to foo.\\nImportant: Make sure to include the slash after the name of the source directory, if you do not include it, it will copy the directory folder over as well.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Data_Transfer&oldid=11737\"'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Duo.html'}, page_content='Duo\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nDuo is the multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution for both UMD centralized information technology resources (DivIT) and UMIACS local resources.  Multi-factor solutions ensure that you have something you know (i.e. your password) and something you have (phone/tablet/token) when trying to authenticate.  This ensures that phishing and other attempts to secure your password do not result in an account compromise and protect you and your data from unauthorized access.\\nEnrollment is discrete and must be done for both UMD (if you have a UMD appointment) and UMIACS individually.  You can enroll the same phone for both of these services, but not the same hardware token (if you use a token for UMD already).  The UMIACS Single Sign-On and our VPN require Duo authentication.\\nDo not share a registered Duo authentication factor with any other UMIACS user for any purpose. Action may be taken against your account if you do so.\\n\\n \\n\\nDuo Login Prompt\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Enrollment\\n2 Management\\n3 Offline Use\\n4 Services\\n5 FAQ\\n\\n\\nEnrollment\\nPlease refer to Duo\\'s Enrollment guide which has comprehensive information on how to enroll your devices.  Your initial sign in for enrollment purposes must be done via our Directory application.\\nWe encourage users to enroll with their smart phone as it provides the most seamless experience.  We also support iOS/Android Tablets, landlines, and U2F FIDO authenticator tokens (though these do not work with our VPN or MFA SSH services).\\n\\nManagement\\nUsers can manage their UMIACS Duo settings as part of the required login to the Directory Application.  Please follow the Duo guide for Managing Devices when you see the Duo login prompt.\\nWe suggest you register using a mobile phone or tablet that is always in your personal possession.  If/When you upgrade or dispose of your currently registered phone/tablet, please consider enrolling your new device before getting rid of your old device.  Activation of your new device will require you to successfully authenticate with a currently registered device.  If you no longer have the device but have kept the same phone number, you can select Call Me to have Duo call you to authenticate your session to manage/enroll your devices.  If you do not have access to your previous device(s) or the phone number, you will need to  contact staff for assistance.\\n\\nOffline Use\\n\\nDuo Offline One-Time Code\\n\\nEntering Your Code\\n\\nFor use when phone data or calls are not available, there are 2 options. \\nYou may use the Duo App on their phone or tablet—without any internet connection—to generate one-time codes that will allow you to authenticate to Duo.  This code will be the input for the secondary login screen for the VPN or the passcode option in the Duo pane of web authentication.  To get a code from the app, open the app and tap on the entry labeled \"Duo-protected UMIACS.\"  This will present a 6 digit passcode.\\nAlternatively, YubiKey hardware tokens can be used with Duo. Hardware tokens must be enrolled by the Technical staff, so if you are interested in procuring a hardware token for use with Duo, please  contact staff. We only support registering YubiKey tokens for this purpose, no other hardware token.\\n\\nServices\\nThe following UMIACS services are secured with our Duo MFA solution.\\n\\n\\nGitLab\\nJira\\n Object Storage\\nVPN\\nDirectory\\nRequests\\nMediaWiki log ins\\n SSH (when coming in from off-campus)\\n\\nFAQ\\nI can no longer clone HTTPS Git repositories in GitLab. How do I work around this?\\nSince we now require more than just your username/password to log into GitLab, you cannot use your UMIACS credentials directly for accessing HTTPS Git repositories.  We encourage you to setup an SSH key instead.  If you have a case where you need to use HTTPS, you can use a Personal Access Token to accomplish this.  Ensure that you create the token with API scope.  You would then use your username as normal and use the token as the password.  Treat this token as a personal secret, as it is sufficient to act as your account within GitLab.\\n\\n\\nHow do I authenticate with a Token?\\nWe only currently support YubiKey tokens for our Duo deployment.  You can follow the instructions from Yubico; you will need to tap the YubiKey once you select the Enter a Passcode field.  It will create a passcode (will look something like kffuastenhldrhfhadafdarivuntddugrvjvllddjjuget) and send a return.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Duo&oldid=11954\"'),\n",

It allows users to create their own repositories and share them with other users/groups or publicly.  It supports built-in project wikis, code review, and issue tracking for each project.  A full list of features can be found on the GitLab website.\\nAll code is hosted on-site on UMIACS servers and is backed up nightly.  We give all non-class account UMIACS users 10 projects with a hard limit of 800Mb per project.  Projects that you create inside of a group namespace still count towards your project limit.  UMIACS Staff can help create Lab groups and delegate authority to manage the group to one or more faculty members.  Permissions are assigned within GitLab.\\nTo get started, navigate to the following URL in your browser, you will be redirected to UMIACS Single Sign On where you can login with your UMIACS credentials:\\n\\n https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\n Note: There might be issues connecting to GitLab if you are using an older git client.

We recommend using SSH because it is more convenient for most users.  The blue \"Clone\" button in the upper-right corner of your GitLab project page will contain the clone URL for whichever authentication method you prefer.\\n\\nSSH\\nTo use SSH, add an SSH key to your GitLab account. Instructions to do so can be found here. Once you have the SSH key added, you can authenticate without having to enter any credentials from the machine and account for which you created the SSH key (if your key is not password-protected).\\n\\nHTTPS\\nThe HTTPS URL can be used as well, but you will need to setup Personal Access Tokens in order to connect. Instructions to create one can be found here. Once you have a token, you can use that as your password when prompted. You will have to re-enter your credentials for GitLab every single time that you attempt to commit to, push to, pull from, or otherwise access the remote repository.\\n\\nMake GitLab projects public\\nMaking projects public grants access to everyone. Projects can only made public by the owner. To make your projects on GitLab public, follow the steps below:\\n1. Go to your project page.\\n2. Click on Settings.\\n3.

The only main difference between the two is that HDMI transfers sound natively, while with VGA you will need to connect an additional 3.5mm audio cable. With either approach, the general steps are as follows:\\n\\nConnect your cable of choice to the device you wish to display on the screen.\\nYou may need an adapter if you are using a laptop.\\n\\n\\nConnect the other end of the cable to the wall port (usually located opposite of the TV).\\n\\nIf you do not see your device automatically appearing on the TV, you may need to turn on the TV or adjust the input of the TV (both done using the remote). \\nIf you do not currently have a remote for your TV, you can get one from the UMIACS Help Desk.\\nTo adjust the input of the TV, click the source button on the remote, located between the volume and channel buttons, and select the proper input named HDMI 1.\\n\\nOnce you connect your device, there are different display modes that can be chosen. Some operating systems may have additional nonstandard options which are described on the individual display mode pages listed below. The following is a description of the basic two modes that all operating systems have:\\n\\nMirror: Displays the same screen on both your computer and the TV.\\nExtend: Will use the TV as a second screen which you can access by moving your mouse off your current display.\\n\\n\\nIf you wish to change your display mode, you can click on the appropriate link below to see a detailed how-to complete with pictures for your particular operating system:\\n\\n Windows Change Display Mode\\n macOS Change Display Mode\\n RHEL Change Display Mode\\n\\nDisplaying Still Images and Playing a Slide Show\\nThere is a USB port on the back of the TV that can be used to display still images or play a slideshow. To be able to follow this guide, you must have a remote which you can pick up from the UMIACS Help Desk if you do not already have one. Now that you have a remote, follow these steps:\\n\\nUpload all of the pictures that you want the TV to display onto a flash drive and plug the flash drive into the USB port on the TV (located around the right edge).\\n\\n\\nClick the source button on the remote and navigate to the MagicInfo S option if it is not already there.\\n\\n\\nYou should now see Player in the top left of your screen. If you do not, either click on the player option if you see one in the menu or click the return button on your remote. Now you should see Player in the upper left of your screen.\\n\\n\\nDirectly below the word Player, there is a dropdown menu that says Internal Memory. Navigate to it and change it to the name of your USB using the remotes navigation buttons.\\n\\n\\nYou can now navigate to and click on a picture to make it display fullscreen.\\nYou may notice that it automatically starts playing a slideshow if you have more than one picture in the same directory. You can click the play and pause buttons on the remote to toggle this behavior.\\n\\n\\nTo change the slideshow speed, orientation, and transition effects, click the options dropdown in the top right of the file explorer. There you can see the many options available to be changed.\\n\\n\\nThe TVs have ~4.5 GB of space available for you to upload files to from your USB. To do this, follow these steps:\\n\\nNavigate to the options menu in the top right and select the Send option.\\n\\n\\nSelect all of the images you want to be stored onto the TV.\\n\\n\\nWhen you are done selecting, click the Send button located in the top right and click Internal Memory from the dropdown. When a popup box appears, click Start.\\n\\n\\nOnce the process completes, you can navigate back to the internal memory through the dropdown in the top left and you will see all of the pictures you selected are now there.\\n\\n\\nYou can now remove the USB and play the images off of your TV.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Iribe/OfficeTV&oldid=8437\"'),\n",

Otherwise, when you email Jira, a ticket is created, and the email address your mail was sent from is added as a participant to the ticket -- this means that if you create a ticket using a non-UMIACS email address, you\\'ll have to login to Jira using that email address to see the ticket.\\n\\nIf you have a UMIACS account\\nSimply login to Jira\\'s Customer Portal and select the UMIACS Single Sign On to login with your UMIACS credentials.\\n\\nIf you do not have a UMIACS account or submitted/were included on a ticket with a non-UMIACS email address\\nThe first time you use a new email address to submit a ticket or are included as a participant on a ticket with a non-UMIACS email address, you will get an automated email containing a link to set a password for the newly-created Jira account. After you have set your full name and password, you can log in with this email address and password at the external user page. If you no longer have the automated email, you can also just go to the external user page, click Forgot your password?, and enter your email address as the username to set it.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Jira&oldid=11871\"'),\n",

It provides a unified password space in which we can manage strong passwords easily and it can prevent your password from being sent across the network as cleartext.\\n\\nWorking with Kerberos\\nWhen you successfully log into any of our Kerberos authenticated systems, you will be granted a set of credentials which will identify you to other network resources. Most users can take advantage of Kerberos without any detailed knowledge about the system.\\nThe only significant complication for some users is that credentials expire after one week at UMIACS. In some environments, the lack of credentials can cause the user environment to behave erratically as network resources become unavailable.\\nWhenever possible, we strongly suggest that users log out of their environments nightly.\\n\\nListing your credentials\\nIt is often useful to examine your current credentials. Using klist, you can verify that your login is correct,\\n\\n -bash-4.2$  klist\\n Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg\\n Default principal: username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\n \\n Valid starting     Expires            Service principal\\n 05/28/18 11:39:36  05/28/18 18:19:36  krbtgt/AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\n\\n\\'Default principal\\' indicates the Kerberos identity of the current process. In this case, the Kerberos principal, \\'username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\' indicates that we are authenticated as the user \\'username\\' to the realm \\'AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU\\'.\\nIf your credentials have not been set up correctly, klist will report:\\n\\n -bash-4.2$  klist\\n klist: No credentials cache found (ticket cache FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg)\\n\\nSingle Sign On Services\\nKerberos authenticated IMAP and SMTP provide secure and convenient methods for sending and reading mail. Unlike traditional IMAP and SMTP services, your password is never sent over the network as cleartext and your password is not cached on a client.\\n\\nPassword Security\\nKerberos security depends on the security of your password. Although Kerberos can make secure access to services convenient, it is still your responsibility to secure your password. Please try to choose a strong password and use secure protocols.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Kerberos&oldid=10385\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'name': 'KVM.html'}, page_content='KVM\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nKVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although work is underway to get the required changes upstream.\\nUsing KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.\\nThe kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux as of 2.6.20.\\nThe system image for the virtual machine should be on local disk space.  Putting a running virtual machine on networked file space will result in poor performance for both the virtual machine, as well as other users of the filespace.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Getting Started\\n2 Creating a virtual machine\\n\\n2.1 Initializing the machine\\n2.2 Forwarding Ports\\n2.3 Windows Example\\n\\nGetting Started\\nIn order to start using KVM on your machine, UMIACS Staff will first need to install the requisite packages and set a baseline configuration.  Please  contact staff along with a brief explanation of your goals for running a local virtual machine.  Note: Ubuntu requires you to be in the kvm group on the local host.\\nOnce staff has installed the required packages you can then use the program \\'virt-manager\\' to initialize and manager your virtual machines.\\n\\nIn a terminal run:\\n\\n\\nvirt-manager -c qemu:///session\\n\\n\\nThis will bring up a graphical interface which can be used to manage various aspects of your virtual machines.  The network that is available is called usermode networking which provides a NAT connection to the outside world.  See below about forwarding ports using qemu-kvm.\\n\\n\\nCreating a virtual machine\\nInitializing the machine\\nIn virt-manager, highlight \\'localhost\\' and then click the \\'New\\' button.  This will bring up a new window that will guide you through configuring your virtual machine.  For the most part, you should stick with the default options.\\n\\nForwarding Ports\\nThis functionality is only available by editing the XML file for your domain directly.  Libvirt has the capability to pass arguments directly to the qemu binary.  First create your VM with virt-manager and then shut it down.  Run in a shell virsh -c qemu:///session which will drop you into the virsh shell.   You can list your VMs both running and off by typing list --all.  Find the name of the VM and type edit NAME where NAME is the name of the VM.\\nYou need to replace the <domain> tag in the first line to:\\n\\n   <domain type=\\'kvm\\' xmlns:qemu=\\'http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0\\'>\\n\\nThen you need to insert the following lines directly above the last line which should have the </domain> tag.  In this case the port 2222 will be forwarded to the port 22.   You may specify multiple ports here but each needs its own -redir line and the port specifications.\\n\\n   <qemu:commandline>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'-redir\\'/>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'tcp:2222::22\\'/>\\n    </qemu:commandline>\\n\\nHere is an example forwarding 3389 to 3389 (RDP) when running Windows (you may need to activate RDP within your Windows VM).\\n\\n   <qemu:commandline>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'-redir\\'/>\\n      <qemu:arg value=\\'tcp:3389::3389\\'/>\\n    </qemu:commandline>\\n\\nWindows Example\\nYou can start a windows install with virt-install in a rather automated fashion.  Here is an example using a Windows 10 x64 ISO with 40G disk and 16GB of RAM. Please note that this should spawn virt-viewer automatically and show you the Windows installer screen.\\n\\nvirt-install --connect qemu:///session --name=win10 --os-type=windows --network user --disk path=/scratch0/username/win10.img,size=40 --cdrom=/scratch0/username/Win10x64.iso --graphics spice --ram=16384\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=KVM&oldid=10299\"'),\n",

LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.\\n\\nLaTeX on Windows\\nIn Windows, it is highly recommended to use a full-featured suite such as TeX Live or MiKTeX. Both of these suites include everything required for end-to-end LaTeX compilation and filetype conversation. Please contact the HelpDesk for assistance with installing or using these on a UMIACS-supported Windows machine.\\n\\nLaTeX on Linux/UNIX\\nMacTeX is available for macOS.\\nTeX Live is available for Linux.\\nMost of our supported Linux systems come with the LaTeX command-line utilities, as well as TeX Live, installed.\\n\\nChecking installed packages\\nTeX Live comes with tons of packages preinstalled. To get a list of installed packages, you must first load the TeX Live GNU module. You can then use the following command:\\n\\n$ tlmgr list --only-installed\\nIf you know which package you are looking for, you can pipe the output into grep to search for specific packages.\\n\\nCompiling to PDF\\nThe following is an example of compiling example.tex to a PDF.\\n\\n    Compile the file into a DVI file by using the latex command.\\n\\n    $ latex example.tex \\nThis is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2013)\\n[...]\\n[1] (./example.aux) )\\nOutput written on example.dvi (1 page, 1692 bytes).\\nTranscript written on example.log.\\n\\n\\n    Use dvipdfmx to convert example.dvi into a PDF (dvipdf or dvipdfm usually would work as well).\\n\\n    $ dvipdfmx example.dvi\\nexample.dvi -> example.pdf\\n[1]\\n12211 bytes written\\n\\n\\nIf your output PDF does not look quite right, you may need to use different conversion tools.

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'LocalDataStorage.html'}, page_content='LocalDataStorage\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nLocal  (data) storage refers to all data that is stored physically at UMIACS, i.e., on hard drives either in servers in datacenters managed by  UMIACS staff, or in UMIACS-supported workstations. The opposite of this is  cloud storage which is stored on third-party providers\\' data hosting platforms.\\nThe below sections outline the different categories of local storage available at UMIACS. Although technically local storage by the above definition, UMIACS also hosts an  Object Store that is documented outside the scope of this page.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Network Home Directory Local Storage\\n2 UNIX Local Storage\\n3 Windows and macOS Local Storage\\n4 Direct-Attached Local Storage\\n5 Network-Attached Local Storage\\n\\n5.1 Network-Attached Local Scratch Storage\\n\\n\\n6 UNIX Local Storage Commands\\n\\n\\nNetwork Home Directory Local Storage\\nWe provide network home directory local storage to each of our users through NFShomes home directories.\\nThis home directory can be accessed via either\\n\\n   /nfshomes/<username> (NFS)\\n\\nor\\n\\n   \\\\\\\\isilondata.umiacs.umd.edu\\\\nfshomes\\\\<username> (CIFS)\\n\\nand is backed up nightly using the Institute\\'s TSM backup system. It also has Snapshots enabled for easy user restores.\\nUsers are given a 30GB, non-expandable Quota. You will need to use either platform-specific local storage, directly-attached local storage, or other network-attached local storage for increased space.\\nOn user account closure, the account\\'s NFShomes home directory goes into our Archives.\\n\\nUNIX Local Storage\\nUNIX hosts use redundant, backed-up network file shares for user directories (above section). Research data storage (below section) is also stored on redundant, possibly-backed-up network file shares and is generally available under /fs/\\nAll UNIX hosts also have local storage available for transitory use. These directories may be used to store temporary, local COPIES of data that is permanently stored elsewhere or as a staging point for output.\\nThese directories may not, under any circumstances, be used as permanent storage for unique, important data. They are not backed up or archived by UMIACS. UMIACS staff cannot recover damaged or deleted data from these directories and will not be responsible for data loss if they are misused. Additionally, on our SLURM compute clusters, these volumes may have an automated cleanup routine that will delete unmodified data after some number of days. You can check the page for the specific cluster you are using for more information.\\nPlease note that /tmp in particular is at risk for data loss or corruption as that directory is regularly used by system processes and services for temporary storage.\\nThese directories include:\\n\\n - /tmp\\n - /scratch0, /scratch1, ... (/scratch#)\\n - any directory named in whole or in part \"tmp\", \"temp\", or \"scratch\".\\n\\nWindows and macOS Local Storage\\nWindows and macOS hosts at UMIACS store user directories on their primary internal drives (C:\\\\Users for Windows, /Users for macOS). Supported, UMIACS-managed hosts automatically back up user data on these drives nightly using the Institute\\'s TSM backup system. If you have a supported, UMIACS-managed host that has other internal or external hard drives attached to it, or other partitions on its primary internal drive, please be aware that these drives/partitions are not backed up. Laptops and non-standard hosts are not automatically backed up and should be manually backed up by their users.\\nOn host decommission, user directories go into our Archives.\\n\\nDirect-Attached Local Storage\\nDirect-attached local storage refers to devices like USB flash drives and USB hard drives, which are very popular for easily expanding storage capacity on a host. However, these devices are significantly more vulnerable to data loss or theft than internal or networked data storage. In general, UMIACS discourages the use of direct-attached local storage when any other option is available. Please note that these devices are prone to high rates of failure and additional steps should be taken to ensure that the data is backed up and that critical or confidential data is not lost or stolen.\\nDirect-attached local storage is not backed up or archived by UMIACS.\\n\\nNetwork-Attached Local Storage\\nSome labs have network-attached local storage space dedicated for datasets, models, and project storage. These shares are typically named in the form /fs/<lab>-<purpose> (i.e., /fs/cml-models or /fs/vulcan-projects).\\nNetwork-attached local storage may or may not be backed up and/or archived by UMIACS. Details of a specific share\\'s retention policy should be stated along with the documentation of the share\\'s access / usage policy. If you find an  documentation network-attached local storage space in this wiki that does not state its retention policy, please  contact staff.\\n\\nNetwork-Attached Local Scratch Storage\\nOne specific sub-category of network-attached local storage is network-attached local scratch storage. These shares are named similarly to local scratch or temporary storage, but with the lab\\'s name included (i.e., /fs/cbcb-scratch or /gammascratch), are intended for scratch/temporary storage, and are subject to the same policies as local scratch/tmp directories, discussed above.\\nNetwork-attached local scratch storage is not backed up or archived by UMIACS.\\n\\nUNIX Local Storage Commands\\nBelow are a few different CLI commands that may prove useful for monitoring your local storage usage and performance. For additional information, run [command] --help or man [command]\\ndf - Shows descriptive file system information\\n\\nUsage: df [OPTION]... [FILE]...\\nShow information about the file system on which each FILE resides,\\nor all file systems by default.\\n\\ndu - Shows disk usage of specific files.

If you would like to enable all the advanced options for the printer, jump over this section to \"Enabling Advanced Printer Options\".\\n\\nJump over to the IP tab\\nSet Protocol to Internet Printing Protocol - IPP\\nSet Address to print.umiacs.umd.edu\\nSet the Queue to printers/queue; in this example for cps432-3208 it would be printers/cps432-3208.  You have to make sure the queue is prefixed by printers/. For clarification, the queue is typically the printer name.\\nSet Name to the name of the printer you are trying to use. This makes it easily Identifiable in your list of printers.\\nIt will always select Generic Postscript Printer.  If you need to access the more advanced features of a queue/printer or you were not able to print by choosing Generic Postscript Printer, you will need to take extra steps, please see the Advanced section at the bottom of this page.\\nSelect Add\\nYou will be asked about enabling duplex. If you know the printer has the option, which is true for most of our printers, go ahead and enable it. Then hit OK. If you\\'re not sure, just leave it disabled. You can always enable it after the queue is added.\\n\\nYou should now be able to print to this printer/queue from any macOS print menu.\\n\\nEnabling Advanced Printer Features\\nSome printers may have features not accessible with the default drivers provided above. If this is the case, follow the guide below to identify, and install your print drivers from their manufacturer.\\n\\n\\nNote: If you already installed the printer with generic drivers, you will need to highlight the printer and click -, before attempting to add it again. You may also need a system update to get the latest drivers from Apple, if your printer does not have software drivers listed in the next steps.\\n\\n\\nStep 1:  Locate your printers name and search for its Make and Model here: http://print.umiacs.umd.edu/printers/\\n\\n\\nStep 2:  Follow the Add Printer steps above until you get to Generic Postscript Printer.

They can also subscribe/unsubscribe by email by sending to\\n\\n  LISTNAME-subscribe\\n\\nor to unsubscribe,\\n\\n  LISTNAME-unsubscribe\\n\\nIn ALL of the above cases, the user will receive email confirming their action. They need to just reply to the mail for this to take affect.\\n\\nIs there an easy way to discard all messages waiting to be reviewed?\\nIf you have a list where non members can post but their messages are moderated, you\\'ll have to deal with a lot of spam. After sometime, just a small percentage of them will be good posts. \\nThe admindb page has a checkbox that allows you to discard all held messages that are marked Defer. On heavy lists with lots of spam holds, this makes clearing them much faster.\\nTo make sure that all mail from non-members is automatically deleted, go to the privacy page followed by the sender-filter sub-page. At the bottom of the page, set to \"discard\" the value for \"Action to take for postings from non-members for which no explicit action is defined.\"\\nOn the same page, at the top, you can do the same thing for postings by members (if your list is moderated such that users can\\'t post).\\n\\nHow do I turn off HTML messages/attachments?\\nOn the admin page, go to the Content Filtering section. \\n\\n Change \"Should Mailman filter ...\" to Yes. \\n\\nIf you leave the rest at default values, including\\n\\n Yes for \"Should Mailman convert text/html parts to plain text?\"\\n\\nyour list will only distribute plain text messages with no attachments.\\n\\nHow can I post from 2 or more addresses to a \"members-only\" list?\\nIf you\\'re subscribed to a members-only list as USER@umiacs.umd.edu and accidentally post as USER@umd.edu, your message will not go through.\\nThe solution is to actually subscribe both addresses to the list, but to disable delivery from all but one of the addresses. So in the above example, I\\'d subscribe USER@umiacs.umd.edu and USER@umd.edu, but I would disable delivery to USER@umd.edu.\\nYou can disable delivery to an address by going to the personal options page for that address and setting \"Mail delivery\" to \"disabled\". \\nThe list manager can disable delivery to an address by going to the membership page and clicking \"no mail\" next to the address in question.\\n\\nHow do I change a member\\'s password or send them their password?\\nGo to the Membership Management page, click the address in question. The page that appears allows you to set a user\\'s password or mail them their existing password by clicking on \\n\\n  \"Email my password to me\"\\n\\nNote all the other options you can set for the user here.\\nDon\\'t forget that members can have their password sent to them anytime they like by clicking the appropriate button on their personal page.

Go to the Membership Management page, and use the Additional Member Tasks to turn on the mod flag for all users.\\nThen go to Privacy Options -> Sender filters and set the default_member_moderation flag to Yes so that new users are automatically set as moderated.\\nSet the member_moderation_action to Reject and add a nice rejection notice text to the following text box.  \\n\\n  Set the generic_nonmember_action to Reject or Discard.\\n\\nHow do I unsubscribe users without them getting an unsubscribe message?\\nBy default, they will not get an unsubscribe message. You need only go to the membership page and click the \"unsub\" button next to each of their names and press \"submit\" or go to the Mass Removal subpage under Membership Management and add all the addresses into the  window and click \"submit\".\\n\\nHow do I edit a held message before approving it for the list?\\nUse the \"forward this message\" feature in the admindb page to forward the message to yourself.\\nAt the same time, discard the original held message. You may want to do this later, after you\\'re sure the message was properly forwarded to you.\\nEdit the message in your mail reader. You should include a notice in the message explaining that the list moderator has edited the message. Please use proper netiquette!\\nResend the message to the list using a Resent-To: header containing the list posting address. Also include an Approved: header containing the list\\'s admin password.\\n\\n\\nWhy don\\'t some messages get to the list?\\nSome lists may have spam filters turned on by staff to eliminate problems.\\nThese filters are under \"Privacy options...\" -> \"Spam filters\".\\nThe most common of these that will be applied is to restrict posts with [QUAR] in the subject.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MailmanFAQ&oldid=11375\"'),\n",

You\\'ll need this password to do various list management things such as add/remove users, approve user subscription or postings for restricted lists, and tailor the list.\\nIf staff was provided with a list of initial subscribers, these people will have already been subscribed. Tell your users that if they\\'d like to subscribe, they need only go to\\n\\n http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME\\n\\neven if the list is private (not advertised or listed).\\nThey can also subscribe/unsubscribe by email by sending to\\n\\n LISTNAME-subscribe and LISTNAME-unsubscribe\\n\\nrespectively. In ALL of the above cases, the user will receive email confirming their action. They need to just reply to the mail for this to take effect.\\n\\nManaging a List\\nTo manage your list, go to:\\n\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME\\n\\nYou will be prompted for the aforementioned password. In general, most of the default settings are likely to be fine but you should know about the following capabilities and pieces of information.\\n\\nJust because you are the list administrator doesn\\'t mean you\\'re subscribed to (or you have to be subscribed to) this list.\\nMessages sent out aren\\'t necessarily delivered immediately; it could take up to 5 minutes.\\n\\n\\nMembership Management\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/members\\n\\nThis is where you can subscribe and unsubscribe users, hide their email addresses, and more.\\n\\nTo subscribe other people, on this form, enter their addresses in the text window under the \"Mass Subscription\" section. Please note that if the user you are adding has a UMD address, you should use that address in order to comply with the Institutional email standard.\\nIf a user goes on vacation, you can change the option to \"nomail\" for them on this form turning off mailing to that individual until he/she returns. Of course, users can do this themselves as well.\\nIf a user forgets their password, clicking on the user\\'s email address on this form allows you to send them an email message containing their password.\\n\\n\\nPrivacy options\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/privacy\\n\\nThis is where you can specify whether or not the list is visible to the world, whether or not administrative approval is required to subscribe to the list, who can view the list of subscribers, who can post to the list (is it open or moderated?), and more.\\n\\nArchiving Options\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/archive\\n\\nThis is where you can choose whether or not to archive messages send to the list. By default, messages are archived and are available only to subscribers of the list using their subscribing password at  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/private/LISTNAME. You can change this to make messages available to the public or turn off archiving entirely. Archives are not searchable.\\n\\nGeneral Settings\\nMost of the defaults for lists are probably fine but a number of them bear special mention. \\nOptions under Subscribing under \"Privacy options\":\\n\\nBy default, no one can see the list.\\nIf this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the first item \"Advertise this list when people ask what lists are on this machine?\" from NO to YES, and then \"Submit Your Changes\" on the bottom of the page. Note that even if users can\\'t see the list, they can still subscribe (or try to subscribe). They simply need to know the URL.\\n\\n\\nBy default, anyone can subscribe to the list. (To ensure that someone can\\'t subscribe someone else as a prank, Mailman sends a confirm email message to the users asking something like, \"You have been subscribed to.... Are you sure you want to subscribe? Just REPLYing to this message will subscribe you\").\\nIf this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the second item \"What steps are required for subscription?\" and click \"Require approval\" or \"Confirm and approve\" and then \"Submit Your Changes\" on the bottom of the page. Approval means that you, as the list administrator, will get a message saying USER@HOST wants to subscribe. You can then approve or discard their request.\\n\\n\\nOption under Membership exposure under \"Privacy options\":\\n\\nBy default, only list members can see the email addresses of other list members. Users can hide their own addresses from their list subscription page. Likewise, you can hide some users and not others from the \"Membership Management\" page.\\nIf you want to broadly change visibility for all users, change the setting on the first item \"Who can view subscription list?\" and click either \"Anyone\" or \"List admin only\" and then \"Submit Your Changes\" on the bottom of the page.\\n\\n\\nModerated Lists\\nSetup\\nIf you want your list to be moderated (i.e. ONLY you and/or a few others can post to it), this can be set at the bottom of the \"Membership Management\" --> \"Membership List\" page. Make sure to also set this for all new members under \"Privacy options\" --> \"Sender filters\". If moderation is set, make sure the list admin (and/or whomever you want to be able to send to the list) has their moderation bit turned off.\\nList admins can add moderators to a list by entering their email addresses in the \"The list moderator email addresses. Multiple moderator addresses, each on separate line is okay.\" box on the \"General Options\" page of the list\\'s admin interface:\\n\\n\\nAs soon as the first moderator is added to the list, a list admin should set the moderator password and communicate it to the initial moderator(s). This password can only be changed by a list admin. It does not give full administrative access to the list.\\n\\nFor list moderators\\nModerators and administrators will receive an email similar to the following if a message is being held for moderation:\\n\\n\\nThe provided URL can also be visited at any time to view the queue of messages pending moderation:\\n\\n  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admindb/LISTNAME\\n\\nFrom here, if there are one or more messages pending moderation, you will see a summary of the messages broken down per-sender. Please note that the addresses in these screenshots are hidden for privacy, but will appear on the actual moderation page.\\nThere are two ways messages from senders may appear on this interface, depending on whether or not the sender is a member of the list:\\n\\nIf the sender is a member of the list (but their moderation bit is on):\\n\\nIf the sender is not a member of the list:\\n\\nFrom these windows, you can choose an action (Defer, Accept, Reject, Discard) for all messages from a specific sender via the radio buttons in the left sub-window, or handle individual messages by clicking on the [#] hyperlinks next to each subject line.\\nThe key difference between the two categories of held messages (from a moderated member vs. from a non-member) is how you can handle future messages from the respective senders in the future:\\n\\nFor moderated members, you can choose the \"Clear this member\\'s moderate flag\" option in the window for that member to automatically allow future messages from them to the list.\\nFor non-members, you can choose to either add the sender\\'s email address to one of the automatic filters for non-members (Accept, Hold, Reject, or Discard) to automatically action their messages in the future. There is also an option to ban the sender\\'s email address from subscribing to the list if you see fit.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MailmanListAdmin&oldid=8927\"'),\n",

The longer the malware had time to propagate, the greater the risk is that this is the case.

This page lists and describes some of them. \\n\\nNote: these are just a few of the many available anti-virus removal tools. One can always search the internet for a well-reputed anti-virus program and use that instead.\\n\\nOnline vs Offline Scanners\\nThere are two types of malware/virus removal tools, online and offline. The main difference between the two is that offline scans work outside of your computer\\'s operating system. This can provide an alternate means for detecting and mitigating threats that may use various tactics to hide from your installed antivirus. On the other hand, online scanners can detect most problems while also being easier to use. Most online scanners have better interfaces than their offline counterparts, and they are usually easier to set up and run. Thus, the best way to remove malware or a virus would be to first try an online scanner and see if the issue still persists. If the online scanner did not fix the problem, then you should try an offline scanner. Below are some links to various online and offline scanners.\\n\\nOnline Scanners\\nF-Secure Online Scan\\nThe online scanner helps to get rid of viruses and spyware that may cause problems on your PC.\\n\\n\\nMalwarebytes\\nThis free version is limited, but can also perform malware and virus scans.\\n\\n\\nOffline/Bootable Scanners\\nMicrosoft Defender Offline\\nThis offline scan only works with machines using Windows 10 or 11.\\n\\n\\nUMIACS-Supported Machines\\nAll UMIACS-supported machines have F-Secure Client Security installed. Follow the steps below to run a manual scan using F-Secure on a UMIACS-supported machine.\\n\\nHow to a run manual F-Secure Scan\\n\\n Open F-Secure Client Security by searching it in the search bar.\\n\\n\\n This should open the F-Secure menu in a popup window in the bottom right of your desktop. If it doesn\\'t, try clicking the up arrow in the bottom right and selecting the F-Secure icon. Note that this screen will always say that your computer is not fully protected. This is because we do not run the Browsing Protection optional feature of the F-Secure suite, as it can cause website accessibility issues. If you click on the More Details link and the checkboxes other than the one that says Turn on Browsing Protection are all green, F-Secure is operating normally.\\n\\n \\n Click on the Manual scanning option in the bottom left side of the window (magnifying glass with a bug in it icon). This will show you your options for manual scanning.\\n\\n \\n Choose either Malware scan or Full computer scan.\\nMalware scan: Searches common places where malware can be found. This makes it faster, but it may miss some hidden malware.\\nFull computer Scan: Scans all internal/external hard drives for malware. This makes it more thorough than the malware scan, but it can take a long time to complete.\\n\\n\\n After choosing an option, another screen should pop up that shows the progress of the scan. \\n\\n \\n Once the scan is complete, it will provide a report stating whether any malware was found. If if did find malware, then it will show you the number of files it removed. You can click View scanning report to see more details about specific files.\\n\\n \\n Click the Close button to close the scan window and complete the scan.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Malware/virus_removal&oldid=10834\"'),\n",

When calling functions in a toolbox, Matlab will automatically check out a license for that toolbox, making it temporarily unavailable to other users. If, while attempting to use Matlab, you run into a license manager error stating that the maximum number of users for Matlab has been reached, this likely indicates that all of campus\\' available licenses are in use. To check the number of licenses available for a specific toolbox, please see the below sections:\\n\\nToolbox Shortnames\\nThe toolbox names themselves don\\'t always work with licensing commands; rather, Matlab has a set of shortnames which can be passed to these commands. The following are the valid shortnames:\\n\\nAerospace_Blockset   \\nAerospace_Toolbox\\nAntenna_Toolbox  \\nBioinformatics_Toolbox  \\nCommunication_Blocks  \\nCommunication_Toolbox  \\nCompiler  \\nControl_Toolbox  \\nCurve_Fitting_Toolbox  \\nData_Acq_Toolbox  \\nDatabase_Toolbox  \\nDatafeed_Toolbox  \\nDistrib_Computing_Toolbox  \\nEconometrics_Toolbox  \\nExcel_Link  \\nFin_Derivatives_Toolbox\\nFin_Instruments_Toolbox  \\nFinancial_Toolbox  \\nFixed_Income_Toolbox  \\nFixed_Point_Toolbox\\nFuzzy_Toolbox \\nGADS_Toolbox  \\nIdentification_Toolbox  \\nImage_Acquisition_Toolbox  \\nImage_Toolbox  \\nInstr_Control_Toolbox  \\nMAP_Toolbox  \\nMATLAB  \\nMATLAB_Builder_for_Java  \\nMATLAB_Coder  \\nMATLAB_Excel_Builder  \\nMATLAB_Report_Gen  \\nMPC_Toolbox  \\nNeural_Network_Toolbox  \\nOptimization_Toolbox\\nOPC_Toolbox  \\nPDE_Toolbox\\nPhased_Array_System_Toolbox  \\nReal-Time_Workshop  \\nRobotics_System_Toolbox \\nRobust_Toolbox\\nRTW_Embedded_Coder\\nSignal_Blocks  \\nSignal_Toolbox\\nSimEvents  \\nSimMechanics  \\nSimscape  \\nSIMULINK  \\nSimulink_Control_Design\\nSimulink_Design_Optim  \\nStateflow  \\nStateflow_Coder  \\nStatistics_Toolbox  \\nSymbolic_Toolbox  \\nVideo_and_Image_Blockset  \\nVirtual_Reality_Toolbox  \\nWavelet_Toolbox\\n\\nIf you are having problems, feel free to contact  UMIACS Staff, however please note that the Matlab license servers are hosted by campus\\' Division of Information Technology.\\n\\nMatlab Customizations\\nYou can tweak your Matlab experience using a file \"startup.m\". If this file is present in the current working directory where you launch Matlab, it will be executed. You can perform a variety of tasks using this file. These include (but are not limited to) customizing the window environment, setting variables for later use, and enabling use of 3rd party toolboxes. Alternatively, you can use the userpath env variable to set a path other than the current working directory for startup and 3rd party toolbox locations.

The only time this will need to be done is if Office is installed on a host that goes an extended length of time (180 days or more) without connecting to the campus network (either physically or through a VPN) and needs to be activated in a hurry.\\n\\nHow to Activate Office\\nPlease note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN, or the  UMIACS VPN to activate. The below steps will assume you have already established a network connection. Please also note that your time must be correct (i.e. set via the Internet) and set to the US Eastern timezone for this to work. You can try running w32tm /resync on the command line below in step 4 before running the other commands listed in that step and subsequent ones to resync your time if the commands fail at first.\\nOnce you are on the campus network follow these instructions:\\n\\nSimple Activation Method\\nOpen any Office product (Word, PowerPoint, etc.). This should automatically activate Office. If it fails to activate, follow the instructions below:\\n\\nCommand Line Activation Method\\nPlease note that your time must be correct for this to work, make sure you are in the East Coast timezone and your time is set via the internet, try running \"w32tm /resync\" on the command line.\\n\\nSearch for Command Prompt in the Start menu, right click it, and choose \"Run as administrator\".\\n\\nRun the following command to determine the bitness of your operating system. This will help you determine which commands you need to run as you continue:\\nwmic os get osarchitecture\\n\\nThe path entered for the rest of the commands will differ slightly depending on the bitness of your operating system and your version and bitness of Office. See here for how to check Office version and bitness. The remaining instructions assume Office 2016 (or newer) 64-bit on Windows 64-bit.\\n64-bit Office, 64-bit Windows: \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\Office16\\\\OSPP.VBS\"\\n32-bit Office, 64-bit Windows: \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\Office16\\\\OSPP.VBS\"\\n32-bit Office, 32-bit Windows: \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\Office16\\\\OSPP.VBS\"\\n\\n\\nSet the correct KMS server.\\ncscript \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\Office16\\\\OSPP.VBS\" /sethst:kms.umd.edu\\n\\nForce an activation against the KMS server.\\ncscript \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\Office16\\\\OSPP.VBS\" /act\\n\\nCheck the licensing status.\\ncscript \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\Office16\\\\OSPP.VBS\" /dstatus\\n\\n\\nThis example shows 1 license, being the standard Office installation.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Microsoft_Office_Activation&oldid=11965\"'),\n",

This provides a way to ensure security updates are installed and activated on the numerous different platforms and appliances that we maintain.\\nThe window for each month is calculated by adding 9 days to Microsoft\\'s Patch Tuesday to allow us to marshal patches released that month from Microsoft, Red Hat, Apple, and other OS and application vendors and have enough time to get our systems prepared to reboot.  This translates to the window being on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month.  The window lasts from 5pm-8pm.\\nNexus will always have a reservation in place from 4:45pm-8pm on the day of the upcoming window to prevent jobs from being scheduled on compute nodes for the entirety of said window as well as 15 minutes before, to allow jobs to fully end. Any job submitted before the reservation begins that has a time limit that would run into the reservation will be held until at least the end of the reservation (8pm on the day of the window).

If your machine happens to have a manually set IP address that conflicts with that of another host, networking issues may arise.\\n\\n\\nAre you behind a firewall?\\nSome establishments use firewalls to restrict certain types of traffic both in and out of their networks.  If you are having trouble accessing a specific service, this might be the case.  To get around this you can connect to the VPN, or use SSH tunneling.\\n\\n\\nOther useful commands:\\ndig: performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried\\nhost: simple utility for performing DNS lookups\\nnetstat (macOS/Linux/UNIX): shows network status\\nroute print (Windows): shows network routing tables\\n\\n\\nChange your default DNS server\\nPlease see  DNS troubleshooting to change your default DNS server.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Network/Troubleshooting&oldid=11254\"'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Nexus.html'}, page_content='Nexus\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nThe Nexus is the combined scheduler of resources in UMIACS.  The resource manager for Nexus is SLURM.  Resources are arranged into partitions where users are able to schedule computational jobs.  Users are arranged into a number of SLURM accounts based on faculty, lab, or center investments.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Getting Started\\n\\n1.1 Access\\n1.2 Jobs\\n\\n1.2.1 Interactive\\n1.2.2 Batch\\n\\n2 Partitions\\n3 Quality of Service (QoS)\\n\\n3.1 Job QoS\\n3.2 Partition QoS\\n\\n\\n4 Storage\\n\\n4.1 Home Directories\\n4.2 Scratch Directories\\n\\n4.2.1 Network Scratch Directories\\n4.2.2 Local Scratch Directories\\n\\n\\n4.3 Faculty Allocations\\n4.4 Project Allocations\\n4.5 Datasets\\n\\nGetting Started\\nAll accounts in UMIACS are sponsored.  If you don\\'t already have a UMIACS account, please see Accounts for information on getting one.  You need a full UMIACS account (not a  collaborator account) in order to access Nexus.\\n\\nAccess\\nYour access to submission nodes (alternatively called login nodes) for Nexus computational resources is determined by your account sponsor\\'s department, center, or lab affiliation.  You can log into the UMIACS Directory CR application and select the Computational Resource (CR) in the list that has the prefix nexus.  The Hosts section lists your available submission nodes - generally a pair of nodes of the format nexus<department, lab, or center abbreviation>[00,01], e.g., nexusgroup00 and nexusgroup01.\\nNote - UMIACS requires multi-factor authentication through our Duo instance.  This is completely discrete from both UMD\\'s and CSD\\'s Duo instances.  You will need to enroll one or more devices to access resources in UMIACS, and will be prompted to enroll when you log into the Directory application for the first time.\\nOnce you have identified your submission nodes, you can SSH directly into them.  From there, you are able to submit to the cluster via our SLURM workload manager.  You need to make sure that your submitted jobs have the correct account, partition, and qos.\\n\\nJobs\\nSLURM jobs are  submitted by either srun or sbatch depending if you are doing an interactive job or batch job, respectively.  You need to provide the where/how/who to run the job and specify the resources you need to run with.\\nFor the who/where/how, you may be required to specify --account, --partition, and/or --qos (respectively) to be able to adequately submit jobs to the Nexus.\\nFor resources, you may need to specify --time for time, --ntasks for CPUs, --mem for RAM, and --gres=gpu for GPUs in your submission arguments to meet your requirements.  There are defaults for all four, so if you don\\'t specify something, you may be scheduled with a very minimal set of time and resources (e.g., by default, NO GPUs are included if you do not specify --gres=gpu).  For more information about submission flags for GPU resources, see  here.  You can also can run man srun on your submission node for a complete list of available submission arguments.\\nFor a list of available GPU types on Nexus and their specs, please see Nexus/GPUs.\\n\\nInteractive\\nOnce logged into a submission node, you can run simple interactive jobs.  If your session is interrupted from the submission node, the job will be killed.  As such, we encourage use of a terminal multiplexer such as Tmux.\\n\\n$ srun --pty --ntasks=4 --mem=2gb --gres=gpu:1 nvidia-smi -L\\nGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-ae5dc1f5-c266-5b9f-58d5-7976e62b3ca1)\\n\\nBatch\\nBatch jobs are scheduled with a script file with an optional ability to embed job scheduling parameters via variables that are defined by #SBATCH lines at the top of the file.  You can find some examples in our SLURM/JobSubmission documentation.\\n\\nPartitions\\nThe SLURM resource manager uses partitions to act as job queues which can restrict size, time and user limits.  The Nexus has a number of different partitions of resources.  Different Centers, Labs, and Faculty are able to invest in computational resources that are restricted to approved users through these partitions.\\nPartitions usable by all non-class account users:\\n\\nNexus/Tron - Pool of resources available to all UMIACS and CSD faculty and graduate students.\\nScavenger - Preemption partition that supports nodes from multiple other partitions.  More resources are available to schedule simultaneously than in other partitions, however jobs are subject to preemption rules.  You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.  The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again. For an overview of things you can check within scripts to determine if your job was preempted/resumed, see SLURM/Preemption. Only contains x86_64 architecture nodes.\\nScavenger (aarch64) - Preemption partition identical in design to scavenger, but only contains aarch64 architecture nodes.\\n\\n\\nPartitions usable by ClassAccounts:\\n\\n Class - Pool available for UMIACS class accounts sponsored by either UMIACS or CSD faculty.\\n\\n\\nPartitions usable by specific lab/center users:\\n\\nNexus/CBCB - CBCB lab pool available for CBCB lab members.\\nNexus/CLIP - CLIP lab pool available for CLIP lab members.\\nNexus/CML - CML lab pool available for CML lab members.\\nNexus/GAMMA - GAMMA lab pool available for GAMMA lab members.\\nNexus/MBRC - MBRC lab pool available for MBRC lab members.\\nNexus/MC2 - MC2 lab pool available for MC2 lab members.\\nNexus/Vulcan - Vulcan lab pool available for Vulcan lab members.\\n\\n\\nQuality of Service (QoS)\\nSLURM uses Quality of Service (QoS) both to provide limits on job sizes (termed by us as \"job QoS\") as well as to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user or per group (termed by us as \"partition QoS\").\\n\\nJob QoS\\nJob QoS are used to provide limits on the size of job that you can run. You should try to allocate only the resources your job actually needs, as resources that each of your jobs schedules are counted against your  fair-share priority in the future.\\n\\ndefault - Default job QoS. Limited to 4 CPU cores, 1 GPU, and 32GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 3 days.\\nmedium - Limited to 8 CPU cores, 2 GPUs, and 64GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 2 days.\\nhigh - Limited to 16 CPU cores, 4 GPUs, and 128GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 1 day.\\nscavenger - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is paired 1-1 with the scavenger partition. To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.  Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.\\nscavenger-aarch64 - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  1600 total CPU cores and 281140MB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is paired 1-1 with the scavenger-aarch64 partition.

Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.\\nFor example, in the default non-preemption partition (tron), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition.\\nLab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two \"TRES\" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition.\\nAll partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill issues with the SLURM scheduler.\\n\\nIf you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an \"outer submission script\" that repeatedly attempts to run an \"inner submission script\" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval.\\n\\n\\nAn example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an  array job, and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less.\\n\\n\\n#!/bin/bash\\nnumjobs=1000\\ni=0\\nwhile [ $i -lt $numjobs ]\\ndo\\n  while [[ \"$(sbatch example_inner.sh 2>&1)\" =~ \"QOSMaxSubmitJobPerUserLimit\" ]]\\n  do\\n    echo \"Currently at maximum job submissions allowed.\"\\n    echo \"Waiting for 5 minutes before trying to submit more jobs.\"\\n    sleep 300\\n  done\\n  i=$(( $i + 1 ))\\n  echo \"Submitted job $i of $numjobs\"\\ndone\\n\\nIt is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.\\n\\nStorage\\nAll network storage available in Nexus is currently NFS based, and comes in a few different flavors. Compute nodes also have local storage that can be used.\\n\\nHome Directories\\nYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.\\nHome directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.\\nNOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.\\n\\nScratch Directories\\nScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Nexus compute infrastructure:\\n\\nNetwork scratch directories\\nLocal scratch directories\\n\\n\\nPlease note that  class accounts do not have network scratch directories.\\n\\nNetwork Scratch Directories\\nYou are allocated 200GB of scratch space via NFS from /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME> where <USERNAME> is your UMIACS username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is  automounted; you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access it.\\nYou can view your quota usage by running df -h /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>.\\nYou may request a permanent increase of up to 400GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 400GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a  project allocation for this. If you choose to increase your scratch space beyond 400GB, the increased space is also subject to the 270 TB days limit mentioned in the project allocation section before we check back in for renewal. For example, if you request 1.4TB total space, you may have this for 270 days (1TB beyond the 400GB permanent increase). The amount increased beyond 400GB will also count against your faculty member\\'s 20TB total storage limit mentioned below.\\nThis file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.\\n\\nLocal Scratch Directories\\nEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on also has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc. and are not backed up or protected in any way.  These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job as they are mounted from disks directly attached to the compute node.  However, you must stage your data within the confines of your job and extract the relevant resultant data elsewhere before the end of your job.\\nThese local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our  monthly maintenance windows.  Please make sure you secure any resultant data you wish to keep from these directories at the end of your job.\\n\\nFaculty Allocations\\nEach faculty member can be allocated 1TB of permanent lab space upon request.  We can also support grouping these individual allocations together into larger center, lab, or research group allocations if desired by the faculty.  Please  contact staff to inquire.\\nLab space storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.\\n\\nProject Allocations\\nProject allocations are available per user for 270 TB days; you can have a 1TB allocation for up to 270 days, a 3TB allocation for 90 days, etc..\\nA single faculty member can not have more than 20TB of project allocations across all of their sponsored accounts active simultaneously. Network scratch allocation space increases beyond the 400GB permanent maximum also have the increase count against this limit (i.e., a 1TB network scratch allocation would have 600GB counted towards this limit).\\nProject storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.\\nThe maximum allocation length you can request is 540 days (500GB space) and the maximum storage space you can request is 9TB (30 day length).\\nTo request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:\\n\\nProject Name (short)\\nDescription\\nSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)\\nLength in days (270 days, 135 days, etc.)\\nOther user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any\\n\\n\\nThese allocations are available via /fs/nexus-projects/<project name>.  Renewal is not guaranteed to be available due to limits on the amount of total storage.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you are still in need of the storage allocation.  If renewal is available, you can renew for up to another 270 TB days with reapproval from the original faculty approver.\\n\\nIf you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.\\nIf you do not respond to staff\\'s request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.\\n\\n\\nDatasets\\nWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/nexus-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.\\nThe list of Nexus datasets we currently host can be viewed here.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus&oldid=12153\"'),\n",

The actual submission hosts are:\\n\\nnexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nnexuscml01.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\n\\nAll partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone CML cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that cml- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone CML cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named cml in the standalone cluster (it is also named just cml in Nexus).\\nHere are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:\\n\\nStandalone CML cluster submission command\\n\\nNexus cluster submission command\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=cml-dpart --qos=cml-medium --account=cml-tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=cml-cpu --qos=cml-cpu --account=cml --pty bash\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=cml-scavenger --qos=cml-scavenger --account=cml-scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash\\n\\nCML users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on CML nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the cml-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all cml## nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named cml.\\nPlease note that the CML compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. CML users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the cml-scavenger partition (i.e., all cml- partition jobs (other than cml-scavenger) can preempt both cml-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and cml-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).\\n\\nPartitions\\nThere are three partitions available to general CML SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.\\n\\ncml-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\ncml-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other cml- partitions are ready to be scheduled.\\ncml-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nThere are two additional partitions available solely to specific faculty members and their sponsored accounts.\\n\\ncml-furongh - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Furong Huang\\'s purchased A6000 node. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\ncml-zhou - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Tianyi Zhou\\'s purchased nodes. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nAccounts\\nThe Center has a base SLURM account cml which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in the cluster have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster, which provides a number of guaranteed billing resources corresponding to the amount that they invested.\\nIf you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the cml account, which only has access to the cml-cpu, cml-default, and cml-medium QoSes (see below section).\\nIf you need access to a different QoS, or if the cml account is at its billing limit (see below in this section), please use your faculty sponsor\\'s account if they have one available. However, keep in mind that if you use your faculty sponsor has their own named partition (see previous section), using the faculty-specific account in the cml-dpart partition may block access to resources in the faculty-specific partition, since the billing limit for the account is charged regardless of what partition is being used.\\nThe current faculty accounts are:\\n\\ncml-abhinav\\ncml-cameron\\ncml-furongh\\ncml-hajiagha\\ncml-john\\ncml-ramani\\ncml-sfeizi\\ncml-tokekar\\ncml-tomg\\ncml-zhou\\n\\n\\n$ sacctmgr show account format=account%20,description%30,organization%10\\n             Account                          Descr        Org\\n-------------------- ------------------------------ ----------\\n                 ...                            ...        ...\\n                 cml                            cml        cml\\n         cml-abhinav      cml - abhinav shrivastava        cml\\n         cml-cameron            cml - maria cameron        cml\\n         cml-furongh             cml - furong huang        cml\\n        cml-hajiagha      cml - mohammad hajiaghayi        cml\\n            cml-john           cml - john dickerson        cml\\n          cml-ramani        cml - ramani duraiswami        cml\\n       cml-scavenger                cml - scavenger        cml\\n          cml-sfeizi             cml - soheil feizi        cml\\n         cml-tokekar           cml - pratap tokekar        cml\\n            cml-tomg            cml - tom goldstein        cml\\n            cml-zhou              cml - tianyi zhou        cml\\n                 ...                            ...        ...\\n\\nFaculty can manage this list of users via our Directory application in the Security Groups section.

It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.\\nHome directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.\\nNOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.\\n\\nProject Directories\\nYou can request project based allocations for up to 6TB for up to 120 days with one or more approvals:\\n\\nAllocations up to and including 3TB require approval from a CML faculty member\\nAllocations above 3TB (up to 6TB) require approval from both a CML faculty member and the director of CML\\n\\n\\nTo request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:\\n\\nProject Name (short)\\nDescription\\nSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)\\nLength in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)\\nOther user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any\\n\\n\\nThese allocations will be available from /fs/cml-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 120 days (requires re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML).  \\n\\nIf you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.\\nIf you do not respond to staff\\'s request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.\\nIf one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.\\n\\n\\nThis data is backed up nightly.\\n\\nScratch Directories\\nScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up.

It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.\\nYou may request a permanent increase of up to 800GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 800GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory. Space increases beyond 800GB also have a maximum request period of 120 days (as with project directories), after which they will need to be renewed with re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML.\\n\\nAs with project directories, allocations over 3TB total space require approval from the director of CML in addition to your faculty member.\\n\\n\\nThis file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.\\n\\nLocal Scratch Directories\\nEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.\\nThese local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.\\n\\nDatasets\\nWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/cml-datasets.

However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named vulcan in the standalone cluster (it is also named just vulcan in Nexus).\\nHere are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:\\n\\nStandalone Vulcan cluster submission command\\n\\nNexus cluster submission command\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=vulcan-dpart --qos=vulcan-medium --account=vulcan-abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=vulcan-cpu --qos=vulcan-cpu --account=vulcan --pty bash\\n\\n\\nsrun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash\\n\\nsrun --partition=vulcan-scavenger --qos=vulcan-scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash\\n\\nVulcan users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on Vulcan nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the vulcan-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all vulcan## in aggregate nodes plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan.\\nPlease note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).\\n\\nNodes\\nThere are currently 46  GPU nodes available running a mixture of NVIDIA RTX A6000, NVIDIA RTX A5000, NVIDIA RTX A4000, NVIDIA Quadro P6000, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, and NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards. There are also 4 CPU-only nodes available.\\nAll nodes are scheduled with the SLURM resource manager.\\n\\nPartitions\\nThere are three partitions available to general Vulcan SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.\\n\\nvulcan-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed. Only nodes with GPUs from architectures before NVIDIA\\'s Ampere architecture are included in this partition.\\nvulcan-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other vulcan- partitions are ready to be scheduled.\\nvulcan-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nThere are a few additional partitions available to subsets of Vulcan users based on specific requirements.\\n\\nvulcan-ampere - This partition contains nodes with GPUs from NVIDIA\\'s Ampere architecture. Job allocations are guaranteed.\\nAs of Thursday 02/29/2024 at 12pm, there is a 4 hour time limit on interactive jobs in this partition. If you need to run longer jobs, you will need to modify your workflow into a job that can be submitted as a batch script.\\nAs of Thursday 03/21/2024 at 5pm, there is a limit of 4 CPUs and 48G memory maximum per GPU requested by a job. If you need to run jobs with more CPUs/memory, you will either need to request more GPUs in the job or use a different partition.\\n\\n\\nSubmission is restricted to the Slurm  accounts of the faculty who invested in these nodes:\\nAbhinav Shrivastava (vulcan-abhinav)\\nJia-Bin Huang (vulcan-jbhuang)\\nChristopher Metzler (vulcan-metzler)\\nMatthias Zwicker (vulcan-zwicker)\\n\\n\\nAccounts\\nVulcan has a base SLURM account vulcan which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in Vulcan compute infrastructure have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster.\\nIf you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the vulcan account.  If your faculty sponsor has their own account, it is recommended to use that account for job submission.\\nThe current faculty accounts are:\\n\\nvulcan-abhinav\\nvulcan-djacobs\\nvulcan-jbhuang\\nvulcan-lsd\\nvulcan-metzler\\nvulcan-rama\\nvulcan-ramani\\nvulcan-yaser\\nvulcan-zwicker\\n\\n\\n$ sacctmgr show account format=account%20,description%30,organization%10\\n             Account                          Descr        Org\\n-------------------- ------------------------------ ----------\\n                 ...                            ...        ...\\n              vulcan                         vulcan     vulcan\\n      vulcan-abhinav   vulcan - abhinav shrivastava     vulcan\\n      vulcan-djacobs          vulcan - david jacobs     vulcan\\n      vulcan-jbhuang         vulcan - jia-bin huang     vulcan\\n          vulcan-lsd           vulcan - larry davis     vulcan\\n      vulcan-metzler         vulcan - chris metzler     vulcan\\n         vulcan-rama        vulcan - rama chellappa     vulcan\\n       vulcan-ramani     vulcan - ramani duraiswami     vulcan\\n        vulcan-yaser          vulcan - yaser yacoob     vulcan\\n      vulcan-zwicker      vulcan - matthias zwicker     vulcan\\n                 ...                            ...        ...\\n\\nFaculty can manage this list of users via our Directory application in the Security Groups section.

Please also review UMIACS  Local Data Storage policies including any volume that is labeled as scratch.\\nVulcan users can also request  Nexus project allocations.\\n\\nHome Directories\\nYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.\\nHome directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.\\nNOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.\\n\\nScratch Directories\\nScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Vulcan compute infrastructure:\\n\\nNetwork scratch directory\\nLocal scratch directories\\n\\n\\nNetwork Scratch Directory\\nYou have 300GB of scratch storage available at /vulcanscratch/<username>.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.\\nYou may request a temporary increase of up to 500GB total space for a maximum of 120 days without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  Once the temporary increase period is over, you will be contacted and given a one-week window of opportunity to clean and secure your data before staff will forcibly remove data to get your space back under 300GB.  If you need space beyond 500GB or for longer than 120 days, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory.\\nThis file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.\\n\\nLocal Scratch Directories\\nEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage their data within the confine of their job and stage the data out before the end of their job.\\nThese local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month at 1am.  Different nodes will run the maintenance jobs on different days of the month to ensure the cluster is still highly available at all times.  Please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.\\n\\nDatasets\\nWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/vulcan-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.\\nThe list of Vulcan datasets we currently host can be viewed here.\\n\\nProject Storage\\nUsers within the Vulcan compute infrastructure can request project based allocations for up to 10TB for up to 180 days by  contacting staff with approval from the Vulcan faculty manager (Dr. Shrivastava).

It is best suited for public content storage/distribution, archiving data or secure data sharing between users. Our Object Store can be used through the web interface, the command line UMobj utilities, third-party graphical  clients, and even programmatically using many popular programming languages.  We support a subset of the Amazon Simple Storage Services (S3) API, built around a technology called Ceph.\\nAll data in our Object Store is stored on hard drives located in a datacenter managed by  UMIACS Staff.\\n\\nTerminology\\nS3-like storage thinks in terms of buckets and keys. Keys are analogous to files. A bucket is simply a container to a set of keys. There is no actual hierarchy inside of a bucket, but the standard UNIX path separator, a forward slash (/) at the end of a Key name, is interpreted by many clients (including this web site and our UMobj utilities) as being a directory delimiter. This allows you to copy data from your local filesystems to your buckets through umobj or third-party clients. You may specify who has what types of access to your buckets via Access Control Lists (ACLs) at the bucket level or the individual key level.\\nYour data is protected from individual machine failure via replication within the cluster. All data is checksummed in accordance with the Amazon S3 protocol to ensure that data in transit is valid before it is accepted by the cluster. However, there are no backups or snapshots of this data in the cluster, so if a user deletes a key or bucket in the Object Store, there is no way to restore that information.\\n\\nGetting Started\\nUMIACS users are allocated 50GB of storage.  Faculty are allocated 10TB. To get started, log in and you will be redirected to the initial help page.  You can also find the link from our https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu site as \"OBJbox Object Store\".\\n\\nBuckets\\nYou can create and browse your buckets (containers that hold data) by visiting your buckets page. You can also set bucket-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) from this page. Bucket-level ACLs get implicitly inherited to all the keys within the bucket. However, individual keys can have additional specific ACLs applied for more granular control.\\nBucket names must be unique. When you create a bucket it will notify you if the name is already taken.\\n\\nKeys (files)\\nAfter selecting a bucket, you will be able to create folders and upload files within that bucket. Listed files can be downloaded, deleted, or assigned a specific ACL by the key owner/creator.\\nPlease note: Local file system ownership and permissions, and special files (such as symlinks) can not be represented in the Object Store. We highly suggest that if you are securing data into the Object Store and need these to be faithfully maintained that you use a local archive tool (tar, zip, etc..) to collect the data and then upload the resulting archive file(s).\\n\\nHosting a Website in your Bucket\\nPlease visit OBJ/WebHosting for more information.\\n\\nDeleting Keys (files)\\nWithin the web interface you can delete files one-by-one. If you want to remove a bunch of files, you will need to use a different client as described below.\\nThis is dangerous as there are no backups of files in the Object Store. Be careful to only delete the data you intend to delete.\\n\\nClients\\nThere are several clients that can be used (sometimes with a limited set of features) on your desktop to gain access to the Object Store. All supported UMIACS systems running RHEL8 have a copy of our UMobj utilities preinstalled which provide command line access to the Object Store. We also have an article in our wiki on  third party clients that lists and explains the details. These clients need to be configured with your Access and Secret Keys as described below.\\n\\nAccess Key and Secret Key\\nEach user has one or more pairs of Access Keys and Secret Keys that are used as a credential to not expose your password when using the Object Store. These can be obtained by clicking on your username in the upper right-hand corner. You\\'ll use these to identify and authenticate yourself to the Object Store.\\nPlease treat your Secret Key(s) with the same confidentiality as a password and do not plaintext it over email or otherwise or share it with any other individuals.\\nWhen using the umobj utilities, you will need to make sure you have added these credentials in your local shell initialization files. There are links to files that have these automatically generated for the 3 most popular UNIX shell families (bash/sh, csh/tcsh, and zsh). Please make sure that whatever file(s) you copy these credentials into can not be read by other users (eg. chmod 600 filename).\\nNote: Each Access Key and Secret Key are specific to a particular object store, so if you are accessing multiple object stores you may want to write the credentials for each to separate files and then source each file when you want to use the associated object store. Please  contact staff if you have any questions.\\n\\nLabGroups\\nLabGroups allow a group of users to share data while avoiding the need for complex ACLs by maintaining group ownership. Designated LabGroup managers can grant granular access (read, write, full control, manager) to buckets owned by the LabGroup. All objects owned by a LabGroup count against the group quota. LabGroups can be navigated using the menu with username in the top right corner of the page. Note: this will only appear if you are a member of at least one LabGroup. At this point, you can browse the Object Store as the LabGroup and obtain your unique Access Key and Secret Key pair using the instructions above. To switch to another LabGroup or back to your own buckets, click the menu again and select another user or group.\\n\\nManaging LabGroups\\nLabGroups have many different levels of membership: Managers, FULL_CONTROL, READ/WRITE, and READ. Managers can add or remove LabGroup Members while every other access level cannot. If you hold the Manager role in a LabGroup, you can add and remove users using the Manage LabGroups page, which is available under the Manage menu at the top of the page. After selecting a LabGroup, you can add users by typing their username into the search field and selecting a membership role.\\n\\nRequesting a LabGroup\\nTo request a LabGroup for your project, please  contact staff.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=OBJ&oldid=12102\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'name': 'OBJ_WebHosting.html'}, page_content='OBJ/WebHosting\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nUMIACS\\'  Object Store has the ability to host websites. On the settings page for each bucket, there is a section allowing you to specify a configuration for a website hosted in your bucket. You can choose keys located in your bucket to act as the index file (what will be displayed when someone visits your website) and the error file (what will be displayed when an error is encountered loading your website). These settings can be updated at any time.\\nBecause hosting a website through your bucket requires others to have access to any keys associated with your website, setting up a website configuration will automatically set the visibility of your bucket to public and remove the bucket level ACLs. You will not be able to set the bucket back to private without first removing the website configuration, which can be done on the bucket settings page.\\nNote: The Object Store only has the capability to support static content and client-side scripting in bucket websites.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Hosting a Website\\n2 Accessing the Website\\n3 Setting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage\\n4 Disabling a Website\\n5 Misc\\n\\n\\nHosting a Website\\nHosting a website in OBJ is quite easy and can be done in a few simple steps. There are three different ways you can set up your OBJ bucket to host a static website.\\nFirst Method (Using the Web Interface):\\n\\nLog into OBJ and create a bucket. Make sure to choose a bucket name carefully since this will be part of the web URL. \\n\\n\\nUpload your index.html file and optional error.html file (and any other required files for your website) on the bucket that you just created.\\nOnce the files are uploaded, click on Bucket Settings\\nOn the settings page, click on the blue Make Public button. \\n\\nUnder Website Hosting, enter the name of your index.html (and optionally error.html) file and hit Submit.\\n\\n\\nSecond Method (Using the UMobj CLI):\\n\\nSet up your environment variables.\\nOn the shell enter mkobj <bucket_name> to create a bucket. Your bucket name must be unique. You can enter lsobj -l to see the existing buckets.\\nCopy all the required files to the bucket: cpobj [source_directory]/file_name <bucket_name>:. For example, cpobj /fs/www-users/jayid-test/index.html jayid-test:\\nCreate a web configuration for your bucket:  webobj -m create -c website --index=index.html --error=error.html <bucket_name>\\nMake your bucket public: chobj -m public <bucket_name>\\n\\n\\nThird Method (Using a Graphical S3 Client):\\n\\nSince there are many different graphical clients available, we won\\'t be able to cover detailed instructions for all of them. The instruction below only applies to Cyberduck.\\n\\nPlease refer to S3Clients to download and install Cyberduck.\\nLog into Cyberduck using the instruction from the previous step.\\nOnce logged in, right-click > New Folder.... Give a unique name to your bucket.\\nRight-click on the bucket you just created, and click on Upload.... You can upload multiple files at once.\\nOnce all the files are uploaded, right-click on the same bucket, and click on info.\\nUnder the Distribution (CDN) tab make sure to leave a checkmark next to Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.\\n\\nNext, click on the drop-down menu next to Index File and select your index.html file (or whatever file you\\'re using as your index file).\\nUnder the Permission tab, add a permission by clicking on the cog icon on the bottom left and click on Everyone. Change the permission for Everyone to READ as shown on the image below.<\\n\\nAccessing the Website\\nYou can access the website by using the default URL which has the form https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io.\\n\\nSetting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage\\nIf you are intending to use the site as your personal UMIACS webpage, once the bucket is configured and all the required files are uploaded, please log into your UMIACS Directory page and update the Home Page attribute to https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io. Replace <Bucket_name> with the name of the bucket you created.\\nAfterwards, www.umiacs.umd.edu/~username will also redirect to your website.\\n\\nDisabling a Website\\nIf you no longer wish to host a website, you can disable the bucket\\'s web configuration.\\n\\nUsing the web interface:\\n\\nClick on the bucket where you are hosting your website and then click on Bucket Settings.\\nOn the settings page you can, click on Remove Website Configuration. Alternatively, you can also click on the Make Private button to make your bucket private and remove any associated web configuration.\\n\\n\\nUsing the CLI:\\n\\nEnter the following command in the terminal: webobj -m delete -c website <bucket_name>\\nUsing a Graphical S3 Client (Cyberduck):\\n\\n\\nRight-click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and click info.\\nClick on the Distribution (CDN) tab and uncheck the box Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.\\n\\n\\nMisc\\nMore commands for umobj\\nS3Clients\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=OBJ/WebHosting&oldid=10661\"'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Phishing.html'}, page_content='Phishing\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nPhishing attacks may be hard to distinguish from legitimate administrative messages, especially those in which the supposed UMIACS staff advise or require users to take administrative actions related to their account (e.g. storage quota, email account, or general account usage). \\nBelow are some helpful tips and practices that will make it easier to distinguish between legitimate UMIACS staff messages and phishing attempts.\\n\\nLegitimate Mail from Staff\\nThe UMIACS intranet site, intranet.umiacs.umd.edu will always have a posted announcement of any administrative actions we wish all UMIACS users to take collectively. We suggest manually typing this address into your browser or having a bookmark for this site. This URL should also always be SSL-secured. Please check that your browser is reporting a secure connection when visiting the site. This will always be the case for any URL in the *.umiacs.umd.edu domain.\\nWhen we do send out requests for advisory and mandatory actions for a user they will usually be signed with a staff member\\'s GPG key. We provide a tool called Verify Staff GPG Messages from the UMIACS intranet site (also linked below). This allows you to paste the text of the message and confirm that the sender is legitimate. Please note that other communications that are initiated by users through our Jira ticket system or in response to these tickets will not be signed.\\n\\nVerify Staff GPG Messages\\n\\n\\nSome Telltale Signs of Phishing\\nThe above steps should ensure that you are properly able to identify legitimate messages sent by staff. Below are some additional generic signs that should help identify phishing attempts.\\n\\nBogus to and from addresses (not within the UMIACS or UMD domains)\\nMessage not directly referencing you by name (e.g. \"Hello user\" or \"Hello researcher\")\\nSender of message demanding that action be taken immediately or consequences will occur (without an appropriate GPG key included)\\nPoor grammar and spelling in the message\\nHyperlinks pointing to different locations than they claim to or shady attachments being included with the message\\nWARNING: Do NOT click on any links or open any attachments in a message you suspect to be a phishing attempt, as these may lead to the execution of malicious programs on your machine. Instead, hover over links to check where they really point to.\\n\\n\\nIf you ever have questions about the legitimacy of a message, please contact the  Help Desk and we can verify whether or not it was sent out by staff.\\n\\nIf You Have Fallen Victim\\nIf you believe you\\'ve fallen victim to a phishing attack or otherwise believe your account may have been compromised, please contact the  Help Desk immediately. The sooner we know about any potential issues, the sooner we can take preventive measures to make sure as little harm is done as possible. This typically will involve a password change as well as possibly locking out access to your account for some period of time while we ensure your account is secure.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Phishing&oldid=11249\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Podman.html'}, page_content='Podman\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nPodman is a daemonless container engine alternative to Docker.  We don\\'t support Docker in many of our environments as it grants trivial administrative control over the host the Docker daemon runs on.  Podman on the other hand has the ability to run containers in user namespaces.  This means that for every user name space in the kernel you create the processes within it will map to a new uid/gid range.  For example, if you are root in your container, you will not be uid 0 outside the container, but instead you will be uid 4294000000.\\nWe still believe that Apptainer is the best option for running containerized workloads on our clustered based resources.  Podman is a good option for developing the containers to be run via Apptainer or building a deliverable for a funding agency.  Please  contact staff if you would like Podman installed on a workstation or standalone server.  More information on Podman running rootless can be found here.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Getting Started\\n\\n1.1 Storage\\n\\n\\n2 GPUs\\n3 Example\\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nTo get started there are a few things that you need to configure.\\nFirst, run the podman command.  If it says command not found or you get an ERRO like the one below about no subuid ranges, and you are on a workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server, please  contact staff with the error and the host that you are using.  We will need to do some steps to setup the host you want ready.\\n\\n$ podman\\nERRO[0000] cannot find mappings for user username: No subuid ranges found for user \"username\" in /etc/subuid\\nError: missing command \\'podman COMMAND\\'\\nTry \\'podman --help\\' for more information.\\n\\nStorage\\nContainers are made up of layers for the image and these are stored in the graphroot setting of ~/.config/containers/storage.conf which by default will be in your home directory.  With our home directories being available over NFS there is an issue that due to the user name space mapping described above you will not be able to access your home directory when you are building the layers.\\nYou need to update the graphroot setting to a local directory on the host.  The file ~/.config/containers/storage.conf may not exist until you run podman the first time, however you can manually create it.\\n\\n[storage]\\n  driver = \"vfs\"\\n  graphroot = \"/scratch0/username/.local/share/containers/storage\"\\n...\\n\\nWhen building larger images, it may fill up the default directory for imageCopyTmpDir (/var/tmp). If this happens, you will need to specify a different directory using the environment variable TMPDIR. For example:\\n\\nexport TMPDIR=\"/scratch0/example_tmp_directory\"\\nGPUs\\nRunning Podman with the local Nvidia GPUs requires some additional configuration steps that staff has to add to any individual workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server that runs Podman.  This includes ensuring the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed.\\nFor example you can run nvidia-smi from within the official Nvidia CUDA containers with a command like this, optionally replacing the tag for different CUDA versions/OS images:\\n\\n$ podman run --rm --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8 nvidia-smi\\nThu Apr 16 18:47:04 2020\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     |\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

See Printing for more details specific to your OS.  We have developed a naming scheme for our printer queues based on the colors the printer can produce, the type of queue, the building number, and the room number.\\nThe naming scheme is as follows:\\n\\nAll color printers begin with a \"c\".  Black & white is the default so nothing extra is needed.\\nThen either \"ps\" for a PostScript-enabled queue or \"pcl\" for a Printer Command Language-enabled queue will appear.  PostScript and PCL are types of printer drivers.  If you are unsure what this means, use \"ps\" for PostScript.  PCL drivers may not always be available.\\nThen add the building number and a dash (\"-\"). E.g. add \"432-\" for IRB, \"115-\" for AVW, or \"224-\" for ATL.\\nThen add the room number. E.g. If the printer is in room 3208, add \"3208\".\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\nps432-3208 is a black & white printer in Iribe 3208.\\ncps224-3261 is a color printer in Atlantic 3261.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=PrinterQueueNaming&oldid=10783\"'),\n",

This page offers best practices and guidelines for publishing your information using our resources. It also offers instructions for storing data that is within your allotted quota.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Best Practices\\n2 LabGroups\\n3 OBJ Usage\\n\\n3.1 Uploading files/data\\n3.2 Publishing Websites\\n\\nBest Practices\\nWhen publishing anything, the following items are important to consider:\\n\\nBe sure that any/all data is published via a faculty member\\'s account or a Labgroup (see below), not a student\\'s. This is especially important when the data in question is meant to be permanent. This will reduce the chance of any broken links once the student leaves and their UMIACS account is archived.\\nOBJ (see below) should be used whenever data or websites are published.\\nMake sure UMIACS is credited on any papers that contain UMIACS URLs.\\n\\n\\nLabGroups\\nLabGroups allow for multiple users to upload data to a central shared location. This is especially useful if multiple people are contributing to a single project. To learn more about LabGroups, visit The OBJ help page or OBJ for more information. \\n\\nOBJ Usage\\nThe use of the  UMIACS Object Storage (otherwise known as OBJ) is the preferred method of publishing websites, data, and related info. Below are some short guides to publish websites and/or data on OBJ.\\n\\nUploading files/data\\nAfter logging in to OBJ, select \"Add Bucket\".\\nA \"bucket\" is essentially a folder that stores files.\\n\\n\\nUpload any datasets or other files that contain the data you wish to publish.\\nFor publishing websites, continue to the \"Publishing Websites\" section. For datasets and the like continue on.\\nIn order to make any files publicly available, click the settings cog on the right side of the file, scroll down, and click \"Make Key Public\"\\nNote that this makes this specific file available to anyone with the link. If you only wish to grant temporary access or access to a specific user, you may want to consider creating a timed download link or modifying the Access Control List at the bottom of the page. More information can be found on the OBJ help page\\n\\n\\nPublishing Websites\\nGenerally, for publishing websites, you\\'ll want to upload all your website files under one bucket. UMIACS recommends that you include an index.html file as well as a error file to be shown in case of a broken link (404). Once all these files are uploaded:\\n\\nIn the bucket, click \"bucket settings\" at the top of the window.\\nUnder the \"Website Hosting\" section, put the name of your index file (usually just index.html) and the name of your 404 page.\\nClick \"Submit\".\\nKeep in mind that this will expose all data in your bucket. We recommend keeping any sensitive/access controlled data in a separate bucket.\\n\\n\\nThe website will be made public and can be reached using the link at the right side. In order to make the website non-public, simply click \"Remove Website Configuration\" and then \"Make Private\" in the above section.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the above, there are more ways to add data to OBJ which can prove useful, especially if working with a lot of files. See The OBJ help page for more information.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Publishing_Data&oldid=12096\"'),\n",

Please see the  Windows Python page.\\n\\nPython Environment\\nPython utilizes a variable called \\'PYTHONPATH\\', which is similar to the PATH variable used in many shells.  The PYTHONPATH variable tells the Python interpreter where to look to find modules.\\nTo view your python path:\\n\\nbash:~$ python -c \\'import sys; print sys.path\\'\\nYou can add directories to your PYTHONPATH either through your shell, or in your Python code itself:\\n\\nbash:~$ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/location/to/directory\\n\\n                 ...or...\\n\\n>>> sys.path.append(\\'/location/to/directory\\')\\nInstalling Modules\\nWhile some of the Versions of Python available in GNU modules provide a default set of modules pre-installed, you may wish to install your own.

Home directories that are mounted from our Isilon NAS will support these kinds of quotas.\\nTo find out what your current quota is, first run df . to find out what file system you are currently mounted from (in this example it is  data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username). Please note that the Use% here is for the entire file system and not your user-specific home directory.\\n\\n# df .\\nFilesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on\\ndata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/username\\n\\nThen run quota and that line will list your quota information for that file system.  If you see errors such as \"Error while getting quota from ...\" you may safely ignore these as some of our file systems do not report quotas correctly.\\n\\n$ quota\\nDisk quotas for user username (uid 13337):\\n     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace\\ndata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username\\n                     24  5138024 5242880              10  10276045 10485760\\n\\nIf you have hit your RPC quota and haven\\'t realized it, you may see some strange issues. For example, you will not be able to write-out files (although \\'touch\\' and file concatenation will succeed). Some applications such as vi will throw \"FSync\" errors. Similarly, commands such as wget will appear to succeed but your files will be zero-length.\\n\\nTree Quotas\\nAn alternate style of quota management is done through tree quotas that show up in how much space is available in the file system by using the df command to inspect either the current path (no arguments given) or a given path.\\nFor example to show my /nfshomes/username home directory quota, I can just use df ~\\n\\n$ df ~\\nFilesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on\\ndata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/username\\n\\nCalculating Space Usage\\nWhen you are looking to diagnose how much space you are using you often want to know how much storage the immediate directories are taking in a certain folder.  The utility to do this is du.  Since *NIX operating systems use the concept of .. for the previous directory simple file globs like .* don\\'t provide exactly what you need since in certain places like your home directories there are a lot of dot files or hidden files (eg. .somename).  To identify all files and directories from the current directory you can use something like du -hs .[^.]* *.\\n\\n-bash-4.2$ du -hs .[^.]* *\\n48K     .bash_history\\n94M     .cache\\n160K    .compiz\\n3.0M    .config\\n32K     .gconf\\n64K     .gnupg\\n48K     .history\\n48K     .ICEauthority\\n4.2M    .local\\n29M     .mozilla\\n224K    .ssh\\n48K     .viminfo\\n48K     .Xauthority\\n48K     .xsession-errors\\n7.2M    catkin_ws\\n32K     Desktop\\n32K     Documents\\n57M     Downloads\\n32K     Music\\n32K     perl5\\n32K     Pictures\\n32K     Public\\n32K     Templates\\n32K     Videos\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Quota&oldid=11465\"'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Rclone.html'}, page_content='Rclone\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nRclone is a command line program useful for syncing files and directories. Its functionality is similar to rsync, but has additional capabilities that support cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Open Drive, Amazon S3, and many more. \\nBelow are directions on how to remote setup rclone on a headless machine. If you would like to set up specific Google Drive or Dropbox remotes, you can go directly to the section labeled \"Google Drive\" or \"Dropbox\".\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Remote Setup on A Headless System\\n\\n1.1 Rclone configuration file\\n1.2 Rclone authorize\\n\\n\\n2 Google Drive\\n\\n2.1 Common Use\\n2.2 Creating a cronjob\\n\\n\\n3 Dropbox\\n\\n\\nRemote Setup on A Headless System\\nTo remote setup rclone, you will first have to SSH into one of UMIACS\\' hosts and load the rclone module by typing module load rclone. If this does not work, check that the rclone module is available by running the command module avail rclone. If the module is not available, SSH to a host where it is.\\nIf you are instead installing rclone on a system that you have administrative privileges on, downloads are available at https://rclone.org/downloads/.\\nOnce you have loaded the module or installed the software, there are two ways to remote configure rclone. The first is by copying the rclone config file, and the second is by using rclone authorize.\\n\\nRclone configuration file\\nTo copy the rclone config file, first configure rclone on your desktop machine. This can be achieved by running the command rclone config to set up the file and then finding the location of the configuration file using the command rclone config file, which should yield output similar to what is below:\\n\\n$ rclone config file\\nConfiguration file is stored at:\\n/home/user/.rclone.conf\\n\\nThis file can then be transferred to the remote box using scp, copy/paste, ftp, sftp, etc. The command rclone config file can also be run on the remote box to find the correct location to which the file should be moved.\\n\\nRclone authorize\\nTo configure using rclone authorize instead, run the command Remote config on your headless machine, and then select the option for working on a headless machine by answering the first prompt with an n. The resulting output should look like this:\\n\\nRemote config\\nUse auto config?\\n * Say Y if not sure\\n * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine\\ny) Yes\\nn) No\\ny/n> n\\n\\nFor this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.\\nExecute the following on your machine:\\n\\trclone authorize \"amazon cloud drive\"\\nThen paste the result below:\\nresult>\\n\\nNext, on your main desktop machine, run the command rclone authorize \"amazon cloud drive\". Follow the link that the output directs you to; you should now have received a secret token on your desktop machine console, in a message similar to the one below:\\n\\nrclone authorize \"amazon cloud drive\"\\nIf your browser doesn\\'t open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth\\nLog in and authorize rclone for access\\nWaiting for code...\\nGot code\\nPaste the following into your remote machine --->\\nSECRET_TOKEN\\n<---End paste\\n\\nGo back to your headless machine and paste the secret message on the console where it says result>. Finally, approve the token by answering the prompts that follow:\\n\\nresult> SECRET_TOKEN\\n--------------------\\n[acd12]\\nclient_id = \\nclient_secret = \\ntoken = SECRET_TOKEN\\n--------------------\\ny) Yes this is OK\\ne) Edit this remote\\nd) Delete this remote\\ny/e/d>\\n\\nIf there are any issues with the remote setup, visit https://rclone.org/remote_setup/ for more information.\\n\\nGoogle Drive\\nIn order to sync files to Google Drive on Linux systems, use of the command line program Rclone is necessary. The first step is to SSH into one of UMIACS\\' hosts with X11 forwarding enabled (use the -XY flag) or (if the host is a workstation) log in over GUI and launch the terminal. If Rclone is already in the module tree, then load the Rclone module using:\\n\\nmodule load rclone\\n\\nIf the module is NOT installed on the machine, install it from here: https://rclone.org/downloads/\\nOnce installed, load into it using the previous command.\\nTo make a new remote, run the command rclone config. This should produce output similar to what is below:\\n\\nn) New remote\\nr) Rename remote\\nc) Copy remote\\ns) Set configuration password\\nq) Quit config\\nn/r/c/s/q> \\n\\nChoose to make a new remote, and give it a name. There should then be prompt asking for the type of storage to configure. Input drive for Google Drive.\\n\\nType of storage to configure.\\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own value\\n 1 / 1Fichier\\n   \\\\ \"fichier\"\\n 2 / Alias for an existing remote\\n   \\\\ \"alias\"\\n ...\\n ...\\n37 / premiumize.me\\n   \\\\ \"premiumizeme\"\\n38 / seafile\\n   \\\\ \"seafile\"\\nStorage> drive\\n\\nWhen prompted for your Google Application Client Id and Secret, it is okay to leave those blank. Rclone will then prompt for a scope that it should use when requesting access from your drive, which you can provide by selecting one of the numbers on the screen. The suggested value for full operation is 1.\\n\\nGoogle Application Client Id\\nSetting your own is recommended.\\nSee https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id for how to create your own.\\nIf you leave this blank, it will use an internal key which is low performance.\\nEnter a string value.

Enter Y.\\n\\nRemote config\\nUse auto config?\\n * Say Y if not sure\\n * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine\\ny) Yes (default)\\nn) No\\ny/n>\\n\\nThe window will then prompt for sign in with a Google account. Sign into your UMD account using your <DIRECTORYID>@umd.edu email. You will then be brought to the UMD CAS Dual Factor Authentication Screen. Sign in with your normal credentials and dual factor authenticate. Allow rclone to access your Google Account.\\nYou will then be prompted to Configure this as a team drive. Enter the default value unless the application requires further customization.\\n\\nConfigure this as a team drive?\\ny) Yes\\nn) No (default)\\ny/n>\\n\\nFinally, confirm your selections if they are correct, edit them if they are incorrect.\\n\\n--------------------\\ny) Yes this is OK (default)\\ne) Edit this remote\\nd) Delete this remote\\ny/e/d> y\\n\\nCommon Use\\nList directories in top level of your drive\\n\\nrclone lsd <REMOTENAME>:\\n\\nList all the files in your drive\\n\\nrclone ls <REMOTENAME>:\\n\\nTo copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup\\n\\nrclone copy /home/source <REMOTENAME>:<NEWBACKUPNAME>\\n\\nMore commands and usage can be found at: https://rclone.org/drive/\\n\\nCreating a cronjob\\nA cronjob will allow you to automate backups. To create a cronjob for an Rclone command, first you must find the path of Rclone. This can be done using the which command.\\n\\n[user@workstation ~]$ which rclone\\n/opt/common/rclone-v1.53.4-linux-amd64/rclone\\n\\nThen use crontab -e to edit your crontab. Once in the crontab, you can input your Rclone command using the command path found previously. An example of an Rclone cronjob that would occur every hour on the hour would be:\\n\\n0 * * * * /opt/common/rclone-v1.53.4-linux-amd64/rclone copy /<PATHTOBEBACKEDUP>/ <REMOTENAME>:<BACKUPNAME>\\n\\nDropbox\\nThese instructions assume that you have SSH\\'d into one of UMIACS\\' hosts and have successfully been able to load the rclone module using the command module load rclone, or installed rclone yourself on a system that you have administrative privileges on. If this is not the case, please do so before proceeding with the Dropbox remote setup.\\nFirst, make a new remote by running the command rclone config. This should produce output similar to what is below:\\n\\nn) New remote\\nr) Rename remote\\nc) Copy remote\\ns) Set configuration password\\nq) Quit config\\nn/r/c/s/q> \\n\\nChoose to make a new remote, and give it a name. The setup will then prompt you to choose a type of storage to configure. You can either choose the number from the options that corresponds to \"Dropbox\", or simply type in dropbox. When prompted for your Dropbox App Key and Secret, it is okay to leave those blank. \\nThe console will then redirect you to a browser page that will prompt you to enter a code displayed on the console and authorize rclone for access. Once you have followed the instructions on the webpage, the console will display your credentials and ask for approval to confirm the remote.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Rclone&oldid=11684\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Remote_Desktop.html'}, page_content='Remote Desktop\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nContents\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n2 How to Connect\\n\\n2.1 Windows\\n2.2 macOS\\n2.3 UNIX\\n\\n\\n3 Redirecting Resources on Windows\\n\\n3.1 Audio Redirection\\n3.2 Other Resource Redirection\\n\\n\\n4 Redirecting Resources on Mac\\n\\n4.1 Folder/Drive Redirection\\n4.2 Other Resource Redirection\\n\\nIntroduction\\nRemote Desktop allows you to connect to another computer from a network that is compatible. Currently, at UMIACS, this feature is only supported for Windows hosts using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). If you need to remotely connect to a UNIX host, please see SecureShell. With RDP, you can control your Windows desktop environment through a graphical user interface. Mouse and keyboard movements are transferred over a network to a Windows host running an RDP server, which sends screen refreshes back. \\nTo access an RDP enabled machine, you must be on the UMIACS physical network or VPN. You must also be authorized to access and remotely control the host you are requesting. If a remote session is active, it is not possible for another user to log onto the console in-person. Attempting to use RDP when a computer is in use by another user could force the existing user to logoff and lose their work. You should always quit RDP by logging off of the remote computer. Simply quitting the RDP client can cause you to stay logged in and prevent other users from accessing the remote host, even at the physical console.\\n\\nHow to Connect\\nPrerequisites:\\nConnected to the  UMIACS VPN or be within the UMIACS network border.\\nBe a member of the \\'Remote Desktop Users\\' group on the remote machine. Please  contact staff if you do not have remote access to a machine you feel you should.\\n\\n\\nWindows\\nFor connecting to Windows client over RDP, we recommend the native Windows \\'Remote Desktop Connection\\' client. \\n\\nTo start the RDC client, click the \"Start\\'\" or \"Windows\" button on the taskbar. In the menu, navigate to \"All Programs,\" \"Accessories,\" then select \"Remote Desktop Connection\". Alternatively, you can search for \"Remote Desktop Connection\" in the Start menu\\'s search field.\\nOnce RDC client starts, type the name of the RDP/Windows host you are trying to access. The name should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN), e.g. desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu where desktop is replaced by the name of the desktop you are trying to connect to. At this point, click \"Connect\" to initiate the RDP session.\\n\\nUpon reaching the Windows Security prompt, enter your UMIACS credentials. Please note that the username must be in the format UMIACS\\\\username, where username is replaced by your UMIACS username. The slash must also be a back slash and not a forward slash. If the username is either not correct or not the desired account, click on \"More choices\" and select \"Use another account\". Click \"Ok\" when you are done.\\n\\nAfter the connection is started, a warning message may alert you to an identity verification failure. For UMIACS machines, you can ignore this and proceed by checking the box and selecting \"Yes\".\\n\\nYou should now be viewing the remote computer. To terminate the session, you should logout of Windows.\\n\\n\\nTo switch between your current host and the remote host, click the minimize or \"-\" button on the top connection bar. With RDC, the clipboard can be transferred between the remote and current host while the RDC client is running and logged in.\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the Microsoft Remote Desktop application from the Windows Store, which is available for download here.\\n\\nOpen Microsoft Remote Desktop.\\nClick \"Add\" in the top right corner.\\n\\nNext, click \"Desktop - Connect to a PC\".\\n\\nType the name of the RDP/Windows host you are trying to access in PC Name. The name should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN), e.g. \"desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu\". Once you have filled that out, click Save.\\n\\nNow, you should be on a page where you will see the PC you have just added. Double-click the PC and enter your UMIACS credentials. Please note that the username must be in the format UMIACS\\\\username (this must be a back slash and not a forward slash). Then, click Connect.\\n\\nIf it asks to \"Accept certificate and connect?\", press Connect.\\n\\n\\nmacOS\\nFor connecting to Windows client over RDP, we recommend the \\'Microsoft Remote Desktop\\' application. Another option, although less preferred, is the CoRD client.\\n\\nOpen the \\'Microsoft Remote Desktop Application\\' and select \\'+ New\\' to create a new device profile\\n\\nFill in the\\'PC Name\\' field with the name of the remote host you wish to connect to. If you wish to redirect resources from the remote machine to your local machine, please see the section titled \\'Redirecting Resources on Mac\\' below. Then press the blue add button in the bottom right corner.\\n\\nYou will now see the device listed below. Double click it to start the connection.\\n\\nYou will then be prompted for the username and password used to log into the remote host. After typing in both the username and password, press the blue continue button.\\n\\nIf you see a screen appear that looks like the one pictured below, press the blue continue button. You should then be connected to the remote host.\\n\\nUNIX\\nIf you are trying to access a Windows host via RDP from UNIX, you should use the xfreerdp client from the command line. This should be preinstalled, so there is no configuration that needs to happen.\\nTo connect via RDP to a remote host with xfreerdp, type the following command, replacing values as appropriate: \\n\\nxfreerdp -d UMIACS -u <USERNAME> --plugin cliprdr -g <GEOMETRY> <HOSTNAME>\\nHere is an explanation of the values above:\\n\\n<GEOMETRY>: Percent of remote host\\'s screen to mirror on the client\\n<USERNAME>: Your UMIACS username (Do not include domain name)\\n<HOSTNAME>: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN) of the desired remote host\\n\\n\\nAs with any of these RDP solutions, closing xfreerdp (using the top bar or using CTRL+C) without logging out could cause considerable problems for other users of the workstation. If you are using a shared workstation, please be sure to logout after you are finished with the remote machine using the Start menu.\\n\\nRedirecting Resources on Windows\\nResource redirection must be set up before connection is established.\\n\\n\\nAudio Redirection\\nThis allows the remote desktop to access the audio capture and playback devices on the user\\'s desktop.\\n\\n\\nClick the \"Show Options\" drop down menu\\nNavigate to the \"Local Resources\" tab\\nClick the \"Settings\" button in the Remote audio box\\nSelect preferred audio preferences\\nSelect \"OK\\nSelect \"Connect\"\\n\\n\\nOther Resource Redirection\\nThis allows the remote desktop to access the drives, printers, and video capture devices on the user\\'s desktop.\\n\\n\\nClick the \"Show Options\" drop down menu.\\nNavigate to the \"Local Resources\" tab.\\nClick the \"More\" button in the Local devices and resources box.\\nClick the checkbox next to the resources you would like to redirect.\\nSelect \"OK\".\\nSelect \"Connect\".\\n\\n\\nRedirecting Resources on Mac\\nIf you have already created the PC connection, right click over the PC connection you wish to add resource redirection to, then select \\'Edit\\'.\\n\\n\\nFolder/Drive Redirection\\nThis allows the remote machine to access specified folders on your local machine.\\n\\n\\nLocated halfway down the screen, select the \\'Folders\\' tab.\\nCheck the box titled \\'Redirect folders,\\' if not checked already.\\nEither select the folder(s) already listed you wish to access from the remote machine by checking the box next to the desired folder, or select the \\'+\\' button, then import and select the folder(s) you wish to access.\\nPress the blue \\'Add\\' button in the bottom right corner, or if you wish to direct other resources as well, see \\'Other Resource Redirection\\' below.\\n\\nOther Resource Redirection\\nThis will allow for camera, printer, and/or microphone access to be shared between machines.\\n\\n\\nLocated halfway down the screen, select the \\'Devices and Audio\\' tab.\\nEnsure the boxes next to the services you would like to redirect are checked. For video, ensure that the \\'Microphone\\' and \\'Camera\\' boxes are checkmarked. For printer access, ensure that the \\'Printers\\' box is checkmarked. Please be mindful to keep \\'Clipboard\\' checkmarked, as that is what allows you to copy and paste between your local machine and the remote machine.\\nPress the blue \\'Add\\' button in the bottom right corner.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Remote_Desktop&oldid=12144\"'),\n",

In this directory, open bin, and find the rstudio.exe file. Running this will open up RStudio. For convenience, it may be preferable to create a shortcut linking to this executable.\\nWhen RStudio first runs, it will prompt you for an R execution environment. Pick the third Choose a specific version of R option, click browse, navigate to the folder in which R was installed, and select this folder.\\n \\nMake sure the folder selected directly contains folders such as bin and include, as RStudio does not recursively search the selected folder for a valid R build. Afterwards, if RStudio prompts you to, choose a version of R to use.\\nRStudio should now launch properly.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=RStudio&oldid=8395\"'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'Screen.html'}, page_content='Screen\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nContents\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n2 Usage\\n3 Common Keyboard Shortcuts\\n4 Important Notes\\n5 .screenrc\\n6 Useful Links\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\nGNU Screen, or \"screen\", is a window management program available on UMIACS Linux hosts that allows multiplexing of a single terminal between multiple virtual consoles. Screen is also capable of separating programs from the shell that initially started it which allows a program to continue running even if the connection to the host has been lost. For this reason screen is typically used when a network connection is unstable and the process must remain running even if an SSH connection has dropped. Screen is also useful when a process may be slow and other processes need to be running. \\n\\nUsage\\nTo invoke screen, simply use the following command in a terminal:\\n\\n# screen\\n\\nAlternatively, to start a program with screen:\\n\\n# screen vi program.c\\n\\nThis will invoke screen and, in the newly-created window, start editing the file program.c in vi.\\nYou can have as many screen sessions as you’d like on a single host, however, keeping track of many sessions can become difficult. As a way to solve this screen offers the capability to give each session a unique name when you start it using the following:\\n\\n# screen -S [session name]\\n\\nIf you need to end your ssh session, but want your processes to keep running you can detach the screen session with:\\n\\n# screen -d\\n\\nThen exit as normal.\\nIf you have multiple screen sessions you can detach and reattach them at any time. To list the current screen sessions running on a host use:\\n\\n# screen -ls\\n\\nThe output will be similar to this:\\n\\n# username@tron02:~$ screen -ls\\n#  There are screens on:\\n# \\t26598.screenTest1\\t(Detached)\\n# \\t18457.pts-0.tron02\\t(Detached)\\n# 2 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-username.\\n\\nTo reconnect to a specific screen session you may use either the screen number or name to reconnect using ‘screen -r’\\n\\n# username@tron02:~$ screen -r 26598\\n\\nor\\n\\n# username@tron02:~$ screen -r screenTest1\\n\\nCommon Keyboard Shortcuts\\nCtrl-A is the metacharacter for commands in screen; press it before every key command.  Some useful commands in screen:\\n\\nCtrl-A + c (Creates a new window.)\\nCtrl-A + d (detach from current session)\\nCtrl-A + [0-9] (Switches to the window corresponding to the number, window 0 is the first window initialized by screen.)\\nCtrl-A + \" (Presents a selection of screen windows from which to choose.)\\nCtrl-A + Shift-A Rename the current screen window\\nCtrl-A + <SPC> / Ctrl-A + <BKSPC> (Switch to the next / previous window.)\\nCtrl-A + k (Kill the current window.)\\nCtrl-A + \\\\ (Kill the screen session and all its windows.)\\n\\n\\nSee the documentation here to see a full list of Ctrl-A commands (Section 5.1: Default Key Bindings).\\n\\nImportant Notes\\nIf you start a screen session that will run a program within a session that has only one window, such as by issuing the command \\n\\n# screen program.c \\n\\nthen when the program exits the screen session will terminate as well. This has the potential to hide any output you may want from your program since the screen session will exit. To solve this issue you can either make sure your shell is not set to auto-logout, or ensure that you have multiple windows open in the screen session so that it will not terminate when the program exits.\\n\\n.screenrc\\nSimilar to .bashrc, the file .screenrc in a user\\'s home directory can be used to customize a screen session\\'s startup behavior.  Commands listed in this file will be executed upon starting screen, and can be useful to set up your environment to display important information such as the window number and name, the name of the host you\\'re connected to, or altering the key sequences for screen commands.

See Nexus Access for more information.\\n\\nThis will give you access to a terminal on any one of the Nexus servers.  Note that by default you will not have access to applications that require X11 to run.\\nAll UMIACS-supported Windows hosts are installed with PuTTY. If you are using a self-supported machine, you can either download and install PuTTY yourself, or if you are running a currently supported version of Windows, you can install the OpenSSH client natively in Windows by following Microsoft\\'s instructions here. Only the client is needed and not the server.\\n\\nX11 Forwarding\\nBy default, SSH only gives the user shell access to a host.  Enabling X11 Forwarding allows users to run applications with Graphical User Interfaces.\\nUnder Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus using X11 Forwarding. Please note that under macOS, xQuartz is required on the client machine to forward X sessions from the remote session.\\n\\n# ssh -Y username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nNote: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.\\n\\nUnder Windows, you will need to forward X through VcXsrv or another X11 application.\\nIf using PuTTY, you will need to enable X forwarding. The option is under Connection > SSH > X11, shown below.\\n\\nIf using the Windows Terminal app, you will need to set an environment variable and then relaunch the app.\\n\\nsetx.exe DISPLAY \"127.0.0.1:0.0\"\\n\\n\\nAfter this has been done, every time you want to use X forwarding, you need to make sure VcXsrv or your other application has been started. If using VcXsrv, there will be an icon in your system tray.\\nYou will now be able to use Xwindow programs from your SSH client.\\n\\nSSH Tunneling\\nYou can tunnel one or more ports through an SSH connection such that your packets will look like they are coming from the host you are tunneling to.   This is helpful for services that you would be normally blocked by a firewall.\\nPlease see the SecureShellTunneling page for more information.\\n\\nSSH Keys (and Passwordless SSH)\\nSSH can utilize public key encryption to authenticate and authorize users. This can be considered more secure especially if you secure your private key with a pass-phrase. The keys themselves are not susceptible to brute force attacks like normal passwords over SSH are.\\nPlease see the SSH/Keys page for more information.\\nNote: UMIACS still requires multi-factor authentication if you are connecting from the public internet for security reasons. If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.\\n\\nVerify remote host SSH fingerprint\\nThe SSH protocol relies on host keys to verify the identify of a given host.  Each host as a unique key for the various different protocols supported.  \\nWhen connecting to a remove host for the first time, or when the remote host\\'s local host key configuration has changed, you may see the following prompt:\\n\\n$ ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nThe authenticity of host \\'nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.73)\\' can\\'t be established.\\nRSA key fingerprint is 25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f.\\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\\n\\nIt is considered best practice to verify the key fingerprint with the actual key of the host.  UMIACS maintains a reference of SSH key fingerprints available at the following link: \\nhttps://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys\\nIt is important to note that each key type has a different fingerprint.  Depending on your local configuration, your client may prefer a specific type of key.  The following commands can be used to determine the fingerprint of a given key type on a remote host:\\n\\n$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu > key\\n# nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0\\n$ ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f key\\n2048 MD5:25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (RSA)\\n\\nIf you have any questions, or notice a discrepancy, please  contact staff.\\n\\nWindows / PuTTY Verification\\nIf you use PuTTY to connect to remote hosts, the prompt will be similar to the following:\\n\\nIf the host key reported by PuTTY matches the Documented entry for that host, it is safe to click \\'yes\\'.  If they do not match, please report the issue to staff@umiacs.umd.edu.\\n\\nOther Platforms\\nWinSCP\\nMobaXterm\\n\\n\\nLong Running Processes\\nIf you are dealing with a long running process that is inhibiting your ability to work regularly, you may want to run your processes inside a screen on the host that you\\'re connecting to. This way, if the connection is dropped for any reason the screen session will automatically detach on the host and will continue running so that you can reattach it at a later time when you\\'ve connected again. Please see our documentation on  GNU Screen for more information.\\n\\nFurther Information\\nOpenSSH\\nOpenSSH on Windows\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SecureShell&oldid=12048\"'),\n",

Public-facing hosts are hosts that are reachable via the Internet (e.g. via ping) without first establishing a connection to our VPN. If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border).\\nSSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and  public key authentication. Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically. Other hardware tokens such as a YubiKey or Duo\\'s own hardware token will still work.\\n\\nExample\\nThe initial command or session setup for connecting to a host with multi-factor authentication enabled over SSH is the same as one that does not have it enabled. Our example for connecting to a host over SSH can be found  here. In the below example, we are also SSH-ing to a Nexus node e.g. ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu\\nOnce you enter the command (if using a native terminal) or start the session (PuTTY or other terminal emulators), you will be presented with the following prompt:\\n\\nPassword:\\n\\nEnter your UMIACS password here (the same as if you were using interactive password authentication to connect to an internal host). After correctly entering your password, you will be taken to the following prompt. Please note: The options shown here will vary depending on what/how many devices you have registered with our Duo instance. In this example, we have a mobile phone that has the Duo app installed, a tablet (iPad) that has the Duo app installed, a Duo hardware token, and a YubiKey all registered against our UMIACS Duo instance.\\n\\nPassword:\\nDuo two-factor login for username\\n\\nEnter a passcode or select one of the following options:\\n\\n 1.

As mentioned previously, you do not need an additional multi-factor authentication step when using SSH if you first connect to our VPN since it is already secured by multi-factor authentication.\\nAn alternative would be to use a terminal multiplexer such as Screen or Tmux to minimize the number of times you need to multi-factor authenticate. Terminal multiplexers allow you to start several different processes out of one terminal display, and also detach from and later reattach to each of the processes.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SecureShell/MFA&oldid=11513\"'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'SetGID.html'}, page_content='SetGID\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nThe setgid bit works in two ways, one for files and one for directories.\\n\\nSetGID Files\\nThe setgid bit for files will force when a file is executed to set its group ID to the GID that of the binary instead of the user that is running it.  This mode has no effect for files that are not executable.  To a lesser extent than SetUID this can lead to security issues when the group in question has some files that would be allowed to be read or written when otherwise not permitted.  There are very limited uses for this feature these days and its use is discouraged.\\n\\nSetGID Directories\\nSetGID directories have a much more benign behavior.  When this bit is set on a directory all filesystem creations underneath that directory will inherit the group from the directory.  UMIACS policy is to keep users\\' default UID and GID.  So for users who wish to have certain directory trees have consistent groups the use of SetGID directories is useful.  The SetGID directory bit will force all files created under that directory to have the same GID.  Any directories created will also be given the same GID and the SetGID bit so that the same policy is applied at the next level of directory down.\\nBefore we give an example of how to use the sticky bit please see the documentation about umask.  SetGID will only work on the GID and the setting a sticky bit and will not change any other permissions.  By default the umask is 022 and is a bit too restrictive for the use of SetGID effectively.  (002 or 007 will be the appropriate setting depending if you want Others to be able to read/execute or not)\\nFirst an example of what our default group is and what other groups we belong to:\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ id\\nuid=9001(username) gid=29001(username) groups=15114(umadmin),29001(username)\\n\\nNow we have created a directory called staff that we want to share with the umadmin group (which is not my default group)\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .\\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 username username   96 Jun 16 11:34 .\\n\\nWe are going to set the new group to umadmin and set rwxrwxr-x permissions.  Then finally we will add the SetGID bit.\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chgrp umadmin .\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod 775 .\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod g+s .\\n\\nNow you can see we have a directory that is correctly set up,\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .\\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 11:34 .\\n\\nWe are going to use umask of 002 since we want to allow others to read the files.\\nWe are going to now create a test file and test directory,\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ touch test\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ mkdir testdir\\n\\nNow as you can see we have the correct groups and permissions being used to create both files directories,\\n\\n[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la\\ndrwxrwsr-x  3 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 .\\n-rw-rw-r--  1 username umadmin    0 Jun 16 12:58 test\\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 testdir\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SetGID&oldid=9837\"'),\n",

It provides three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive or non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n Submitting Jobs\\n Checking Job Status\\n Checking Cluster Status\\n Understanding Job Priority\\n Job Preemption Overview\\nOfficial Documentation\\nFAQ\\n\\n\\nRelated documentation:\\n\\n Optimizing Storage Performance\\n Using VS Code\\n\\n\\nCommands\\nBelow are some of the common commands used in Slurm. Further information on how to use these commands is found in the documentation linked above. To see all flags available for a command, please check the command\\'s manual by using man <COMMAND> on the command line.\\n\\nsrun\\nsrun runs a parallel job on a cluster managed by Slurm.  If necessary, it will first create a resource allocation in which to run the parallel job.\\n\\nsalloc\\nsalloc allocates a Slurm job allocation, which is a set of resources (nodes), possibly with some set of constraints (e.g. number of processors per node).  When salloc successfully obtains the requested allocation, it then runs the command specified by the user.  Finally, when the user specified command is complete, salloc relinquishes the job allocation.  If no command is specified, salloc runs the user\\'s default shell.\\n\\nsbatch\\nsbatch submits a batch script to Slurm.  The batch script may be given to sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified, sbatch will read in a script from standard input.  The batch script may contain options preceded with #SBATCH before any executable commands in the script.\\n\\nsqueue\\nsqueue views job and job step information for jobs managed by Slurm.\\n\\nscancel\\nscancel signals or cancels jobs, job arrays, or job steps.  An arbitrary number of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a space separated list of specific job and/or job step IDs.\\n\\nsacct\\nsacct displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log file or Slurm database in a variety of forms for your analysis.  The sacct command displays information on jobs, job steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output with the use of the --format= option to specify the fields to be shown.\\n\\nsstat\\nsstat displays job status information for your analysis.  The sstat command displays information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node, Resident Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory (VM).  You can tailor the output with the use of the --fields= option to specify the fields to be shown.\\n\\nModules\\nIf you are trying to use  GNU Modules in a Slurm job, please read the section of our Modules documentation on  non-interactive shell sessions.  This also needs to be done if the OS version of the compute node you are scheduled on is different from the OS version of the submission node you are submitting the job from.\\n\\nRunning Jupyter Notebook on a Compute Node\\nThe steps to run a Jupyter Notebook from a compute node are listed below.\\n\\nSetting up your Python Virtual Environment\\n Create a Python virtual environment on the compute node you are assigned and  activate it. Next, install Jupyter using pip by following the steps here. You may also use other environment management systems such as Conda if desired.\\n\\nRunning Jupyter Notebook\\nAfter you\\'ve set up the Python virtual environment, submit a job, activate the environment within the job, and run the following command on the compute node you are assigned:\\n\\njupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 --ip=0.0.0.0\\n\\nThis will start running the notebook on port 8889. Note: You must keep this shell window open to be able to connect. If the submission node for the cluster you are using is not accessible via the public internet, you must also be on a machine connected to the UMIACS network or connected to our  VPN in order to access the Jupyter notebook once you start the SSH tunnel, so ensure this is the case before starting the tunnel. Then, on your local machine, run\\n\\nssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:<NODENAME>:8889 <USERNAME>@<SUBMISSIONNODE>.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nThis will tunnel port 8889 from the compute node to port 8888 on your local machine, using <SUBMISSIONNODE> as an intermediate node. Make sure to replace <USERNAME> with your username, <SUBMISSIONNODE> with the name of the submission node you want to use, and <NODENAME> with the name of the compute node you are assigned. Note that this command will not display any output if the connection is successful due to the included ssh flags. You must also keep this shell window open to be able to connect.\\nFor example, assuming your username is username and that you are using the Nexus cluster, have been  assigned the nexusgroup submission nodes, and are assigned compute node tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:\\n\\nssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:8889 username@nexusgroup.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nYou can then open a web browser and type in localhost:8888 to access the notebook.\\nNotes:\\n\\nLater versions of Jupyter have token authentication enabled by default - you will need to prepend the /?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX part of the URL provided by the terminal output after starting the notebook in order to connect if this is the case. e.g. localhost:8888/?token=fcc6bd0f996e7aa89376c33cb34f7b80890502aacc97d98e\\nIf the port on the compute node mentioned in the example above (8889) is not working, it may be that someone else has already started a process (Jupyter notebook or otherwise) using that specific port number on that specific compute node.

Use show_qos and show_partition_qos to identify the limit(s) and then use scontrol show job <jobid> for each of your jobs running in that QoS to see the resources they are currently consuming.\\nAssocGrpBilling - The SLURM account you are using has a limit on the overall billing amount available in total for the account.  Use sacctmgr show assoc account=<accountname> where user= to identify the limit, replacing <accountname> with the account you are submitting your job with.  You can see all jobs running under the account and their billing values by running squeue -A <accountname> -O \"JobId:.18 ,Partition:.9 ,Name:.8 ,UserName:.8 ,StateCompact:.2 ,TimeUsed:.10 ,NumNodes:.6 ,ReasonList:45 ,tres-alloc:80\". The billing value will be part of the tres-alloc string for each job.\\nReqNodeNotAvail - None of the nodes that could run your job (based on requested partition/resources) currently have the resources to fit your job.  Alternatively, if you also see Reserved for maintenance, there is a reservation in place (often for a  maintenance window).  You can see the current reservations by running scontrol show reservation.  Often the culprit is that you have requested a TimeLimit that will conflict with the reservation.  You can either lower your TimeLimit such that the job will complete before the reservation begins, or leave your job to wait until the reservation completes.\\n\\n\\nSLURM\\'s full list of reasons/explanations can be found here.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/JobStatus&oldid=12005\"'),\n",

It is important to understand the different options available and how to request the resources required for a job in order for it to run successfully. All job submission should be done from submit nodes; any computational code should be run in a job allocation on compute nodes. The following commands outline how to allocate resources on the compute nodes and submit processes to be run on the allocated nodes.\\nThe cluster that everyone with a  UMIACS account has access to is Nexus. Please visit the Nexus page for instructions on how to connect to your assigned submit nodes.\\nComputationally intensive processes run on submission nodes will be terminated. Please submit jobs to be scheduled on compute nodes for this purpose.\\nFor details on how SLURM decides how to schedule jobs when multiple jobs are waiting in a scheduler\\'s queue, please see SLURM/Priority.\\n\\nsrun\\nThe srun command is used to run a process on the compute nodes in the cluster. If you pass it a normal shell command (or command that executes a script), it will submit a job to run that shell command/script on a compute node and then return. srun accepts many command line options to specify the resources required by the command passed to it. Some common command line arguments are listed below and full documentation of all available options is available in the man page for srun, which can be accessed by running man srun.\\n\\n$ srun --qos=default --mem=100mb --time=1:00:00 bash -c \\'echo \"Hello World from\" `hostname`\\'\\nHello World from tron33.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nIt is important to understand that srun is an interactive command. By default input to srun is broadcast to all compute nodes running your process and output from the compute nodes is redirected to srun. This behavior can be changed; however, srun will always wait for the command passed to finish before exiting, so if you start a long running process and end your terminal session, your process will stop running on the compute nodes and your job will end. To run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with  sbatch.\\n\\nCommon srun Arguments\\n--job-name=<JOBNAME> Requests your job be named <JOBNAME>\\n--mem=1g Requests 1GB of memory for your job, if no unit is given MB is assumed\\n--ntasks=2 Requests 2 \"tasks\" which map to cores on a CPU for your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each core\\n--nodes=2 Requests 2 nodes be allocated to your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each node\\n--nodelist=<NODENAME> Requests to run your job on the <NODENAME> node\\n--time=dd-hh:mm:ss Requests your job run for dd days, hh hours, mm minutes, and ss seconds\\n--error=<ERRNAME> Redirects stderr for your job to the <ERRNAME> file\\n--partition=<PARTITIONNAME> Requests your job run in the <PARTITIONNAME> partition\\n--qos=<QOSNAME>default Requests your job run with the <QOSNAME> QOS, to see the available QOS options on a cluster, run show_qos\\n--account=<ACCOUNTNAME> Requests your job runs under the <ACCOUNTNAME> Slurm account, different accounts have different available partitions/QOS\\n--output=<OUTNAME> Redirects stdout for your job to the <OUTNAME> file\\n--requeue Requests your job be automatically requeued if it is preempted\\n--exclusive Requests your job be the only one running on the node(s) it is assigned to. This requires that your job be allocated all of the resources on the node(s). The scheduler does not automatically give your job all of the node\\'s/nodes\\' resources, however, so if you need more than the default, you still need to request these with --ntasks and --mem\\n\\n\\nInteractive Shell Sessions\\nAn interactive shell session on a compute node can be useful for debugging or developing code that isn\\'t ready to be run as a batch job. To get an interactive shell on a node, use srun with the --pty argument to invoke a shell:\\n\\n$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash\\n$ hostname\\ntron33.umiacs.umd.edu\\n\\nPlease do not leave interactive shells running for long periods of time when you are not working. This blocks resources from being used by everyone else.\\n\\nsalloc\\nThe salloc command can also be used to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script. Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation. When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.\\n\\n$ salloc --qos=default -N 1 --mem=2g --time=01:00:00\\nsalloc: Granted job allocation 159\\n$ srun /usr/bin/hostname\\ntron33.umiacs.umd.edu\\n$ exit\\nexit\\nsalloc: Relinquishing job allocation 159\\n\\nPlease note that any commands not invoked with srun will be run locally on the submit node. Please be careful when using salloc.\\n\\nsbatch\\nThe sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes. To run a simple Hello World command on the compute nodes you could write a file, helloWorld.sh with the following contents:\\n\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\nsrun bash -c \\'echo Hello World from `hostname`\\'\\n\\nThen you need to submit the script with sbatch and request resources:\\n\\n$ sbatch --qos=default --mem=1g --time=1:00:00 helloWorld.sh\\nSubmitted batch job 121\\n\\nSLURM will return a job number that you can use to check the status of your job with squeue:\\n\\n$ squeue\\n             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\\n               121      tron helloWor username  R       0:01      1 tron32\\n\\nAdvanced Batch Scripts\\nYou can also write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself. This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one \"job step\". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node. Since srun is blocks until the command finishes, we use the \\'&\\' operator to background the process so that both job steps can run at once; however, this means that we then need to use the wait command to block processing until all background processes have finished.\\n\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\n# Lines that begin with #SBATCH specify commands to be used by SLURM for scheduling\\n\\n#SBATCH --job-name=helloWorld                                        # sets the job name\\n#SBATCH --output=helloWorld.out.%j                                   # indicates a file to redirect STDOUT to; %j is the jobid. If set, must be set to a file instead of a directory or else submission will fail.\\n#SBATCH --error=helloWorld.out.%j                                    # indicates a file to redirect STDERR to; %j is the jobid.

It can be passed individual job IDs or an option to delete all of your jobs or jobs that meet certain criteria.\\n\\nscancel 255 cancel job 255\\nscancel 255.3 cancel job step 3 of job 255\\nscancel --user username --partition=tron cancel all jobs for username in the tron partition\\n\\n\\nIdentifying Resources and Features\\nThe sinfo command can show you additional features of nodes in the cluster but you need to ask it to show some non-default options using a command like sinfo -o \"%40N %8c %8m %35f %35G\".\\n\\n$ sinfo -o \"%40N %8c %8m %35f %35G\"\\nNODELIST

It essentially wraps the sinfo command with some pre-determined output format options and shows each node on its own line, in alphabetical order.\\nTo only view nodes in a specific partition, append -p <partition name> to the command alias.\\n\\nExamples\\n$ show_nodes\\nNODELIST             CPUS       MEMORY     AVAIL_FEATURES                           GRES                             STATE\\nbrigid16             48         512897     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7443               (null)                           idle\\nbrigid17             48         512897     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7443               (null)                           idle\\n...                  ...        ...        ...                                      ...                              ...\\nvulcan45             32         513250     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7313,Ampere        gpu:rtxa6000:8                   idle\\n\\n(specific partition)\\n\\n$ show_nodes -p tron\\nNODELIST             CPUS       MEMORY     AVAIL_FEATURES                           GRES                             STATE\\ntron00               32         255233     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7302,Ampere        gpu:rtxa6000:8                   idle\\ntron01               32         255233     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7302,Ampere        gpu:rtxa6000:8                   idle\\n...                  ...        ...        ...                                      ...                              ...\\ntron69               32         383030     rhel8,x86_64,Xeon,4216,Turing            gpu:rtx2080ti:8                  idle\\n\\nshow_available_nodes\\nThe show_available_nodes command alias takes zero or more arguments that correspond to Slurm constructs, resources, or features that you are looking to request a job with and tells you what nodes could theoretically[0,1] run a job with these arguments immediately. It assumes your job is a single-node job.\\nThese arguments are:\\n\\n--partition: Only include nodes in the specified partition(s).\\n--account: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified account(s).\\n--qos: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified QoS(es).\\n--cpus: Only include nodes with at least this many CPUs free.\\n--mem: Only include nodes with at least this much memory free. The default unit is MB if unspecified, but any of {K,M,G,T} can be suffixed to the number provided (will then be interpreted as KB, MB, GB, or TB, respectively).\\nGRES-related arguments:\\n--gres, --and-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains all of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings.\\n--or-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains any of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gres if only one GRES type/quantity pairing is specified.\\n\\n\\nGPU-related arguments:\\n--gpus, --and-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains all of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings.\\n--or-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains any of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gpus if only one GPU type/quantity pairing is specified.\\n\\n\\nFeature-related arguments:\\n--feature, --and-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains all of the specified feature(s).\\n--or-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains any of the specified feature(s). Functionally identical to --and-feature if only one feature is specified.\\n\\n\\nThese arguments are also viewable by running show_available_nodes -h.\\nIf your passed argument set does not contain any resource-based arguments (CPUs/RAM/GRES or GPUs), a node is defined as available if it has at least 1 CPU and 1MB of RAM available.\\nIf there are no nodes available that meet your passed argument set, you will receive the message There are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n[0] - As of now, this command alias does not factor in resources occupied by jobs that could be preempted (based on the partition(s) passed to it, if present). This is soon to come.\\n[1] - This command alias also does not factor in jobs with higher priority values requesting more resources, in the same partition(s), blocking execution of a job submitted with the arguments checked by the command alias. This is due to the complexity of calculating a job\\'s priority value before it is actually submitted.\\n\\nExamples\\nShow all available nodes:\\n\\n$ show_available_nodes\\nbrigid17\\n  cpus=16,mem=414593M\\nbrigid18\\n  cpus=8,mem=24875M\\n...\\n\\nShow nodes available in the tron partition:\\n\\n$ show_available_nodes --partition tron\\ntron00\\n  cpus=14,mem=50433M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:1\\ntron01\\n  cpus=10,mem=17665M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:2\\n...\\n\\nShow nodes with one or more RTX A5000 or RTX A6000 GPUs available to the vulcan account:\\n\\n$ show_available_nodes --account vulcan --or-gpus rtxa5000:1,rtxa6000:1\\nvulcan32\\n  cpus=16,mem=193778M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:4\\nvulcan33\\n  cpus=15,mem=181499M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:3\\n...\\n\\nShow nodes with 4 or more CPUs, 48G or more memory, and one or more RTX A6000 GPUs available in the scavenger partition:\\n\\n$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --cpus=4 --mem=48g --or-gpus=rtxa6000:1\\ncbcb27\\n  cpus=59,mem=218303M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:6\\nclip06\\n  cpus=20,mem=93448M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:1\\n...\\n\\nShow nodes with Turing or Ampere architecture GPUs available in the scavenger partition:\\n\\n$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --or-feature=Ampere,Turing\\ncbcb25\\n  cpus=24,mem=255278M,gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:1,gpu:gtx1080ti:1\\ncbcb26\\n  cpus=127,mem=447707M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:7\\n...\\n\\nShow nodes with Zen architecture CPUs and Ampere architecture GPUs available in the scavenger partition:\\n\\n$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --and-feature=Zen,Ampere\\ncbcb26\\n  cpus=127,mem=447707M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:7\\ncbcb27\\n  cpus=59,mem=218303M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:6\\n...\\n\\n(bogus example) Attempt to show nodes available in the bogus partition:\\n\\n$ show_available_nodes --partition=bogus\\nThere are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.\\n\\nRequesting GPUs\\nIf you need to do processing on a GPU, you will need to request that your job have access to GPUs just as you need to request processors or CPU cores. In SLURM, GPUs are considered \"generic resources\" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:#. If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec\\'d GPU.\\nNote that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs.\\n\\n$ srun --pty --qos=medium --gres=gpu:2 nvidia-smi\\n...\\nWed Mar  6 16:59:39 2024\\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     |\\n|-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\\n| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Here we are documenting some Slurm behaviors that you can use to determine if your job has been cancelled or preempted. You should be able to take different code paths during startup/shutdown of your jobs based on this information.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Flowchart for job cancellation/preemption\\n\\n1.1 Cancellation\\n1.2 Preemption/Requeue\\n\\n\\n2 Key takeaways\\n\\n2.1 On job cancellation/preemption\\n2.2 On resuming\\n\\n\\n3 Testing\\n\\n\\nFlowchart for job cancellation/preemption\\nCancellation\\nSlurm controller sends an internal cancel signal to Slurm node(s) where the job is currently assigned.\\nSlurm node(s) send SIGCONT and SIGTERM around the same time, and the following fields of note are set in the output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID:\\njob_state = [\\'CANCELLED\\', \\'COMPLETING\\']\\n\\n\\nIf the processes don\\'t stop within a certain amount of time, eventually SIGKILL will be sent.\\n\\n\\nPreemption/Requeue\\nSlurm controller sends an internal preemption/requeue signal to Slurm node(s) where the job is currently assigned.\\nSlurm node(s) send SIGCONT and SIGTERM around the same time, and the following fields of note are set in the output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID:\\njob_state = [\\'PENDING\\', \\'COMPLETING\\']\\nrestart_cnt += 1\\n\\n\\nIf the processes don\\'t stop within a certain amount of time, eventually SIGKILL will be sent.\\nOnce the job is stopped, it enters the PENDING state for two minutes, and then is eligible to be run again.\\nWhen the job runs again, an additional environment variable will be defined, SLURM_RESTART_COUNT, which reports the number of times the job has been preempted/requeued.\\n\\n\\nKey takeaways\\nOn job cancellation/preemption\\nYou can handle the SIGTERM signal and run scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID within your script. Based on the value of job_state, your script can take a different codepath depending on if it was cancelled or was preempted.\\nThe output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID is equivalent to the Slurm REST API\\'s endpoint \"GET /slurm/v0.0.40/job/{job_id}\". For more information on how to parse the output of this scontrol command, please refer to Slurm\\'s REST API documentation. [1]\\n\\nOn resuming\\nIf your job needs to behave differently based on whether or not it was previously preempted, you can check if the environment variable SLURM_RESTART_COUNT is defined.\\n\\nTesting\\nYou can use the following commands to manually cancel and requeue your jobs (requeueing and preemption are handled similarly). With these tools, you can test your scripts to ensure that they gracefully handle these scenarios.\\nCancellation: scancel <job id>\\nPreemption: scontrol requeue <job id>\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/Preemption&oldid=11792\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'name': 'SLURM_Priority.html'}, page_content='SLURM/Priority\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nSLURM at UMIACS is configured to prioritize jobs based on a number of factors, termed multifactor priority in SLURM. Each job submitted to the scheduler is assigned a priority value, which can be viewed in the output of scontrol show job <jobid>.\\nExample:\\n\\n$ scontrol show job 1\\nJobId=1 JobName=bash\\n   UserId=username(13337) GroupId=username(13337) MCS_label=N/A\\n   Priority=10841 Nice=0 Account=nexus QOS=default\\n...\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Pending Jobs\\n2 Priority Factors\\n\\n2.1 Age\\n2.2 Association\\n2.3 Partition\\n2.4 Fair-share\\n\\n2.4.1 GPU partitions\\n2.4.2 CPU-only partitions\\n\\n\\n2.5 Nice value\\n\\nPending Jobs\\nIf the partition that you submit your job to cannot instantly begin your job due to no compute node(s) having the resources free to run it, your job will remain in the Pending state with the listed reason (Resources). If there is another job already pending with this reason, you submit a job to the same partition, and your job gets assigned a lower priority value than that pending job, your job will instead remain in the Pending state with reason (Priority). If there are multiple jobs pending and your job is not the highest priority job pending, the scheduler will only begin execution of your job if starting your job would not push the begin times for any higher priority jobs in the same partition further back.\\nLowering some combination of the resources you are requesting and/or the time limit may allow submitted jobs to run more quickly or instantly during times where a partition is under resource pressure. The command squeue -j <jobid> --start can be used to provide a time estimate for when your job will start, where <jobid> is the job ID you receive from either srun or sbatch.\\nYou can use the command alias  show_available_nodes with a variety of different submission arguments to get a better idea of what jobs may be able to begin sooner.\\n\\nPriority Factors\\nThe priority factors in use at UMIACS include:\\n\\nAge of job i.e. time spent waiting to run in the queue\\nAssociation (SLURM account) being used\\nPartition job was submitted to\\nFair-share of resources\\n\"Nice\" value that job was submitted with\\n\\n\\nAge\\nThe longer a job is eligible to run but cannot due to resources being unavailable, the higher the job\\'s priority becomes as it continue to wait in the queue. The priority modifier for this factor reaches its limit after 7 days.\\n\\nAssociation\\nSome lab/center-specific SLURM accounts may have priority values directly attached to them. Jobs run under these accounts gain this many extra points of priority.\\n\\nPartition\\nThe partitions whose names are or are prefixed with scavenger on each of our clusters always have lower priority factors for their jobs than all other partitions on that cluster. As mentioned in other UMIACS cluster-specific documentation, jobs submitted to these partitions are also preemptable. These two design choices give the partitions their names; jobs submitted to scavenger named or prefixed partitions \"scavenge\" for available resources on the cluster rather than consume dedicated resources, and are interrupted by jobs asking to consume dedicated resources.\\nOn Nexus, labs/centers may also have their own scavenger partitions (<labname>-scavenger) if the faculty for the lab/center have decided upon some sort of limit on jobs (number of simultaneous jobs, number of actively consumed billing resources, etc.) in their non-scavenger partitions. These lab/center scavenger partitions allow for more jobs to be run by members of that lab/center on that lab\\'s/center\\'s nodes only, but are preemptable by that lab\\'s/center\\'s non-scavenger partition jobs.\\nIn decreasing order of priority (highest first), our priority tiers for partitions are:\\n\\nAccount-specific non-preemptable partitions\\nLab/center-specific non-\"scavenger\" named partitions\\nLab/center-specific \"scavenger\" named partitions\\nInstitute-wide scavenger partitions\\n\\n\\nA job in a lower priority tier will never have a higher priority value than any job in any of the higher priority tiers.\\n\\nFair-share\\nThe more resources your jobs have already consumed within an account, the lower priority factor your future jobs will have when compared to other users\\' jobs in the same account who have used fewer resources (so as to \"fair-share\" with other users). Additionally, if there are multiple accounts that can submit to a partition, and the sum of resources of all users\\' jobs within account A is greater than the sum of resources of all users\\' jobs within account B, the lower priority factor all future jobs from users in account A will have when compared to all future jobs from users in account B. (In other words, fair-share is hierarchical.)\\nYou can view the various fair-share statistics with the command sshare -l. It will show your specific FairShare values (always between 0.0 and 1.0) within accounts that you have access to. You can also view other accounts\\' Level Fairshare (LevelFS).\\n\\nAccount                    User  RawShares  NormShares    RawUsage   NormUsage  EffectvUsage  FairShare    LevelFS

the TRESBillingWeights line in the output of scontrol show partition. The billing value for a job is the sum of all resource weightings for resources the job has requested. This value is then multiplied by the amount of time a job has run in seconds to get the amount it contributes to the RawUsage for the association within the account it is running under.\\nThe algorithm we use for resource weightings differs depending on if there are any GPUs in a partition or not, and is as follows:\\n\\nGPU partitions\\nEach resource (memory/CPU/GPU) is given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (33.33% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU/GPU values are adjusted accordingly.\\nDifferent GPU types may also be weighted differently within the GPU relative billing. A baseline GPU type is first chosen. All GPUs of that type and other types that have lower FP32 performance (in TFLOPS) are given a weighting factor of 1.0. GPU types with higher FP32 performance than the baseline GPU are given a weighting factor calculated by dividing their FP32 performance by the baseline GPU\\'s FP32 performance. The weighting values for each GPU type are then determined by normalizing the sum of all of GPU cards\\' billing values multiplied by their weighting factors against the relative billing percentage for GPUs (33.33%).\\nThe current baseline GPU is the NVIDIA RTX A4000.\\n\\nCPU-only partitions\\nEach resource (memory/CPU) is first given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (50% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU value is adjusted accordingly. The final CPU weight value is then divided by 10, which ends up translating to roughly 90.9% of the billing weight being for memory and 9.1% being for CPU. The division of the CPU value is done so as to not affect accounts\\' fair-share priority factors as much when running CPU-only jobs given the popularity of GPU computing.\\n\\nNice value\\nThis is a submission argument that you as the user can include when submitting your jobs to deprioritize them. Larger values will deprioritize jobs more e.g.,\\n\\nsrun --pty --nice=2 bash\\nwill have lower priority than\\n\\nsrun --pty --nice=1 bash\\nwhich will have lower priority than\\n\\nsrun --pty bash\\nassuming all three jobs were submitted at the same time. You cannot use negative values for this argument.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/Priority&oldid=12154\"'),\n",

Snapshots provide a fast, user-accessible way to recover data that has been accidentally deleted or corrupted within a recent time window, rather than having to retrieve the data from comparatively slow tape backups. They also help to span the time gap between  full backups.\\nWe provide snapshots on our Isilon, ZFS, VAST, and Qumulo filers to certain file systems.

If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\n\\nThe  SSH Agents section is not a required component of creating and using an SSH key, but can be very useful if you choose to create a password to protect your SSH key, but find yourself needing to enter that password many times in a session.  SSH Agents allow you to temporarily use your SSH key without a password for a set period of time. Please see the  SSH Agents section for more information.\\n\\n\\nCreate and store the key pair\\nThe first step is to generate a key which will create two files filled with long strings of characters.  A public key file that you may distribute to any machine you want to use it on and a private key that needs to be kept secure.  Allowing anyone to read this private key will compromise the security of the key and could allow someone to access any resources secured by this key without your consent. There are a number of different key types but rsa is the most compatible.  \\n\\nWindows\\nGit Bash\\nSee  Linux/MacOS/Bash and Git Bash (for Windows)\\nPuTTY\\n\\n\\nClick on the start menu and search for PuTTYgen. Open the application\\nVerify that you are attempting to create an \"SSH2 RSA\" key by clicking on the appropriate box\\nClick generate and follow the instructions for generating your keys\\nAdd passphrase if wanted and save both the public and private keys\\n\\n\\nTTSSH2\\n\\n\\nOpen the application\\nCancel the first box\\nGo to setup on the menu bar and go to SSH KeyGenerator\\nClick generate and follow the instructions for generating your key\\nAdd passphrase if wanted and save both the public and private keys\\n\\n\\nLinux/MacOS/Bash and Git Bash (for Windows)\\nCreate a new key with a password\\n\\n\\nYou can run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa to generate the new public and private key.  It will prompt you for a file to create the private key and then for the public key append .pub extension and store it in the same directory.  Pressing enter at the passphrase step twice will create a key without a pass-phrase.\\nNote: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with \\'id\\', such as \\'id_umiacs_rsa\\'.\\n\\nExample: \\n\\n-bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa\\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):\\nCreated directory \\'/home/username/.ssh\\'.\\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\\nEnter same passphrase again:\\nYour identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.\\nYour public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\\nThe key fingerprint is:\\n32:bf:db:74:1b:7e:d7:c6:4b:b5:6f:a8:82:55:3f:bf username@localhost.localdomain\\nThe key\\'s randomart image is:\\n+--[ RSA 2048]----+\\n|                 |\\n|                 |\\n|                 |\\n|            .    |\\n|      o S  . .  .|\\n|       +  .   o o|\\n|        .o. o  B.|\\n|        .+.o o+ O|\\n|        o...+o E+|\\n+-----------------+\\n\\nCreate a new key without a password\\n\\n\\nYou can simplify the existing example above by telling it you do not want a pass-phrase and can run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\".\\nNote: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with \\'id\\', such as \\'id_umiacs_rsa\\'.\\n\\nExample: \\n\\n-bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\"\\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):\\nCreated directory \\'/home/username/.ssh\\'.\\nYour identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.\\nYour public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\\nThe key fingerprint is:\\nff:7a:99:28:fc:63:d6:10:44:4c:2e:68:76:44:76:7a username@localhost.localdomain\\nThe key\\'s randomart image is:\\n+--[ RSA 2048]----+\\n|       .+++      |\\n|       + +o      |\\n|      + +.E      |\\n|     o . o.      |\\n|        S  .     |\\n|         ..      |\\n|       .  .+ o   |\\n|        o =.=    |\\n|         =o+.    |\\n+-----------------+\\n\\nModify permissions\\n\\n\\nModify the permissions of your .ssh directory as well as the private key file that you just created with chmod.\\n\\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh \\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\\n\\nIf you named your file something other than id_rsa, change id_rsa to the name of the file.\\n\\nCopy the public key\\nOnce you have a generated a key pair you will want to add it to one or more computers to allow you to access them.  \\n\\nWindows\\nFor Windows hosts you can use WinSCP to copy the public key file onto a remote host. The root file system for the Bash Subsystem for Windows is located under C:\\\\Users\\\\username>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\lxss\\\\\\n\\nLinux/MacOS/Bash and Git Bash (for Windows)\\nThis can be done with the ssh-copy-id command and it will prompt you the first time for your current password (NOT your pass-phrase). You can replace localhost with any other hostname you want to copy the key to. You can also specify an alternate user or identity file if you need to, please man ssh-copy-id for more information within your terminal. This command will ensure that not only it copies your key but secures the file so that no one can tamper and add additional authorized keys to the file on the remote host. \\n\\nExample: \\n\\n-bash-4.2$ ssh-copy-id localhost\\n/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\\n/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\\nusername@localhost\\'s password:\\n\\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\\n\\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh \\'localhost\\'\"\\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\\n\\nAdding Keys to SSH Clients (Windows Only)\\nPuTTY\\n\\n\\nOpen PuTTY and enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the host you wish to connect to.\\nGo to the Connections tab on the side panel and click on the data subsection.\\nUnder data enter your default user into the first box.

When creating a key for use with SLURM, follow the above instructions for creating keys without passwords.\\nAfter creating this key pair please make sure you follow the  copy the public key instructions above to localhost. This will ensure that your key will be usable on all the cluster nodes since they have a shared home directory.\\n\\nSSH Agents\\nWhile it is very useful to protect your SSH key pair with a pass-phrase it can very time consuming to re-type the pass-phrase over and over. SSH provides a agent that runs in the background and allow you add a key(s) to it with a time limit that they will be unlocked for.\\n\\nssh-agent bash\\nssh-add -t $TIME\\n\\nThe time specified by -t is specified in seconds.\\nExample:\\n(The following would start a bash shell with passwordless SSH active for 30 minutes.)\\n\\nssh-agent bash\\nssh-add -t 1800\\n\\nYou will be prompted for your passphrase and, when entered correctly, you will be able to SSH without entering a password. You can check what keys are load when you are running inside a ssh-agent by using the command ssh-add -l.\\n\\nExample: \\n\\nbash-4.2$ ssh-add -l\\n2048 ee:83:10:c8:2f:2c:17:5e:ef:80:42:7e:ff:75:9e:53 /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SSH/Keys&oldid=11867\"'),\n",

The umask is represented similarly as three digits, each representing a 3 bits. For each bit that is set to 1 in the umask the corresponding bit of any files or directories that are created is set to 0. In binary operations it is equivelent to bitwise negating the umask and then doing a bitwise and on that negation and the default for the object being created. \\nThe three popular umasks are 022, 002 and 007.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 umask 022\\n2 umask 002\\n3 umask 007\\n4 umask 000\\n5 Setting umask\\n\\n\\numask 022\\nThis as the example shows above that you will get full rwx for the user, r-x for the group and r-x for other.  This is the default in almost all of our operating systems.\\n\\n        777  111 111 111\\n  umask 022  000 010 010   \\n      = 755  111 101 101\\n\\numask 002\\nThis would give full rwx for the user, full rwx for the group and give only r-x for other.  This is helpful when you want your default group (or a SetGID directory) to have full control over the files and directories you create while allowing everyone else read and execute permissions.\\n\\n        777  111 111 111\\n  umask 002  000 000 010   \\n      = 775  111 111 101\\n\\numask 007\\nThis will give the user and group full rwx permissions and give other no permissions.\\n\\n        777  111 111 111\\n  umask 007  000 000 111   \\n      = 770  111 111 000\\n\\numask 000\\nPlease never use this umask as it will give full control to user, group and other.   In other words it makes the directory or file world read, write and executable and can be a large security risk to you and your colleagues.\\n\\nSetting umask\\nYour umask is tied to your current shell and can be set with the shell builtin command umask. If issued without an argument the umask will return the current umask, occasionally omitting any leading zeros. To set a umask issue the umask command with umask you want to use.\\n\\n[gnorts:~] username% umask \\n022\\n[gnorts:~] username% umask 002\\n[gnorts:~] username% umask\\n002\\n\\n\\nHowever most of the time, you find yourself in a work environment where the same umask is what you want to use all the time, and you don\\'t want to have to think about it. In that you case you want to set your umask in your shell initialization file. For bash the initialization file is .profile or .bash_profile and for tcsh the initialization files is .cshrc or .tcshrc. These files behave mostly like scripts and the umask command can be entered without any additional syntax as seen in the example bellow:\\n\\n [username@nexuscfar01 ~]$ cat .cshrc \\n setenv EDITOR vim\\n umask 002\\n\\nOr for example if you use Bash you can run this command.\\n\\n echo \\'umask 002\\' >> ~/.bash_profile\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Umask&oldid=11013\"'),\n",

They include the programs \\'lpr\\', \\'lprm\\', \\'lpq\\', and \\'lpstat\\'.\\nAll of the UNIX queues are configured to handle postscript. See the examples section for more information on how to print different file types.\\nBasic Commands\\n\\nlpr\\nUse `lpr -Pprintername filename.ps` to submit the postscript file named filename.ps to the printer queue named printername. If no filename is specified, lpr reads from standard input. If no printer name is specified, then the job is discarded by the print server.\\nAdditional options to specify media handling, page orientation, and double sided printing can be passed to the print spooler using one or more -Z options. Double sided printing is specified with -Zduplex. Page orientation is controlled with -Zportrait, -Zlandscape. Manual feed media (eg. transparencies) is specified with -Zmanual. Please note that not all printers support all -Z options.\\n\\nnscript\\nUse `nscript -Pprintername filename.txt` to send the text file named filename.txt to the printer named printername. If no filename is specified, then nscript reads from standard input.\\nNscript is a weak attempt to simulate Adobe Systems Incorporated nscript programs. It supports a handful of interesting arguments. With the \\'-G\\' argument, nscript generates gaudy output that includes header information on each page. The \\'-2\\' argument generates two column output and \\'-r\\' rotates the job\\'s orientation to landscape mode.\\n\\nlprm\\nUse \\'lprm -Pprintername\\' to remove jobs from the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it removes the first removable job in the queue. Given a job\\'s id as an argument, it will remove the specified job from the queue and you can remove all removable jobs from a queue with the argument \"all\".\\nYou are able to remove items from the queue that you have submitted from anywhere, not just the computer from which the job was submitted.\\n\\nlpq\\nUse \\'lpq -Pprintername\\' to get the status of the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it will print the printer queue, the host queried, and the number of jobs in the queue. With the -l argument, it will specify the id, queue rank, the total size of the job in bytes, and any errors encountered in processing the job.\\n\\nGenerate Postscript\\nPostscript is a Page Description Language that is understood by high quality printers and typically generated by applications. There is a lot of documentation about using and programming in postscript, but for our purposes you\\'ll just need to generate postscript from an existing text file.\\nYou can generate postscript from an existing text file with textps. For example, to convert the Message of the Day file to a postscript file try `textps ... > file.ps`.\\n\\nPreview your job\\nIt\\'s helpful to preview your postscript files before printing by calling Ghostview with `ghostview file.ps`.\\nHigher quality previewing is available using Ghostview\\'s derivativegv. You can call it as `gv file.ps`.\\nBoth commands should open a window that displays the contents of your postscript file.\\n\\nChoose a print queue\\nPrint queues are described here:  Print Queues.\\nYou can check list all the print queues with `lpq -a` and you can list just a single queue `lpq -Pprintername` -- eg. ps432-3208 with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.\\n\\nSend a print job\\nAfter you choose a suitable printer (eg. ps432-3208), you can send your postscript file to the printer with `lpr -Pps432-3208 file.ps`.\\n\\nMonitor a print job\\nYou can monitor the job you sent to the printer (eg. ps432-3208) with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.\\nLpq will return the following output:\\n\\n[herzog 33] lpq -Pps432-3208\\nPrinter: ps432-3208@lpr1 (dest raw@ps432-3208.umiacs.umd.edu) \\'HP M653 in IRB 3208\\'\\nQueue: 2 printable jobs\\nServer: pid 11833 active\\nUnspooler: pid 11837 active\\nStatus: waiting for subserver to exit at 14:50:45.141\\nRank   Owner/ID                  Class Job Files                 Size Time\\nactive username@herzog+198           A   198 file.ps               4309 14:50:44\\n2      username2@prime+199           A   199 hpss.ps               4309 14:50:45\\nActive connection from  128.8.120.247\\nWaiting connection from 128.8.120.247\\n\\nRemove a Print Job\\nIf you would like to remove your job from the queue, you should get the job\\'s id from the output of `lpq`. You can remove it with `lprm -Pps432-3208 198`\\nFrom the output of lpq, I can see that the job id is 198 and I can remove it with lprm as follows:\\n\\n[herzog 35] lprm -Pps432-3208 198\\nPrinter ps432-3208@durer:\\nchecking perms \\'username@herzog+198\\'\\ndequeued \\'username@herzog+198\\'\\n\\nOften the last job listed in the printer queue has already spooled to the printer, and lprm will be unable to delete the job.  In this case, the only way to cancel the job will be to press the \\'cancel\\' button on the printer.\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=UNIXPrinting&oldid=9829\"'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'name': 'VS_Code.html'}, page_content='VS Code\\n\\nFrom UMIACS\\n\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nVisual Studio (VS) Code is a multi-platform source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be used with a variety of programming languages and can have its base functionality extended through extensions available via its marketplace. The base editor itself is free, but some extensions may require paid subscriptions.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Cluster Usage\\n\\n1.1 Best Practices\\n\\n1.1.1 Use only as a code editor\\n1.1.2 Do not open large files\\n1.1.3 Clean up when done\\n\\n2 Common Issues\\n\\n\\nCluster Usage\\nIt can be convenient when using our SLURM computing clusters to open a connection to a VS Code Server session on the submission node(s) that you have access to via VS Code\\'s Remote - SSH extension. Steps to set this up can be found here. Use your UMIACS username and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the submission node you want to connect to. Password authentication does not provide an option to save your password, so for convenience, you may want to set up an  SSH key.\\nFor a list of active issues with the Remote - SSH extension, please see Microsoft\\'s GitHub tracker here.\\n\\nBest Practices\\nBecause of the multi-tenant nature of our submission nodes, using the Remote - SSH extension to connect to a VS Code Server running on a submission node can have adverse affects on other users simultaneously using the submission nodes if not properly managed. The following is a list of \"best practices\" that we ask you please follow to minimize the chance of impacting others on submission nodes. We have compiled the list through observation as well as through discussion with users.\\n\\nUse only as a code editor\\nVS Code can perform many common file management operations, such as moving, copying, or deleting files or directories. However, the overhead of providing progress updates / status messages through VS Code\\'s UI can cause load spikes that result in other processes on the submission node (both system-level and other users\\') slowing down. This is especially the case if operating on thousands to millions of small image or video files. In extreme cases, it can seem as though the submission node is wholly unresponsive.\\nThe best way to combat this is to use VS Code as just a code editor as strictly as you can (meaning creating new and/or editing existing source code files only). Use standard command-line programs such as mv/cp/rm in VS Code\\'s terminal window or a separate application\\'s terminal window for local file management instead, or use the techniques advertised  here for larger data transfers between nodes.\\n\\nDo not open large files\\nFiles that you open in VS Code\\'s text editor on a remote machine through the Remote - SSH extension are loaded entirely into RAM on the remote machine. Because of the persistence of VS Code Server processes, opening several unique files may result in them all remaining in RAM for extended periods of time even if you no longer have tabs open for them in the Tab Bar.\\nAs such, please refrain from opening large files (more than a few MB) in VS Code itself on submission nodes. Either use a lighter-weight command-line based text editor such as vim or otherwise on the submission node itself, or first  transfer the files that you would like to open to either a less-used remote machine or your local machine before opening them.\\nIf you absolutely need to open one or more large files for a very brief period of time on a submission node, please clean up your server session on that node (see below section) as soon as possible when done.\\n\\nClean up when done\\nIf you are done using VS Code for an extended period of time (several hours / overnight), consider manually killing your server session on the submission node when exiting. By default, VS Code Server will keep the processes used by your session active for a few hours after you disconnect, keeping the VS Code Server processes on the submission node you were using alive, despite no longer actively being used.\\nThis can be done by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching \"Kill VS Code Server on Host...\".\\n\\n\\nSelect the submission node you were using and click on it.\\n\\n\\nWait a few seconds and you should get a message confirming the command went through.\\n\\n\\nThe next time you connect to the same submission node, you will have a fresh VS Code session on it.\\n\\nCommon Issues\\nIf you are having trouble SSH\\'ing to a submission node with VS Code, check if your home directory is full.\\n\\nConnect to one of your Nexus submission nodes via SSH not using VS Code.\\n Remote connect to a server\\n\\n\\nNavigate to your home directory. cd ~\\n\\n\\nCheck if it is full. df -h .\\n\\n\\nIf it is full (Avail 0), delete some files to free up at least ~100MB of space.

The services that they provide may also not be adequately built for programmatic crawling.  In this case, these organizations may ban IP addresses or ranges if crawling is observed on those IP addresses or ranges.  This can then prevent other individuals from using these services from the same IP addresses or ranges.

Such information is encrypted in memory upon receipt and sent to a designated email address, the owner of which will decrypt it using a email encryption/decryption program.\\nThe recommended email encryption/decryption software at UMIACS is WinPT (Windows Privacy Tray), a small and powerful software from http://winpt.wald.intevation.org/. It is freely available to all users. It must be noted that you need GnuPG 1.4.11 or higher installed on your computer to use WinPT. You can download GnuPG for free from the GnuPG website.\\n\\nWinPT Instructions\\nThe first time you run this program, you will be asked to generate your \"keypair\". A keypair contains a public key, which is usually used for encryption, and a private key, which is used for decryption.\\nNow you are ready to encrypt and decrypt messages. To do so: \\n\\nSimply copy the text you wish to encrypt/decrypt into the Windows clipboard (i.e., use \"copy\" or \"ctrl-v\")\\nClick on the WinPT icon in the lower-right corner of the screen\\nSelect the approriate menu item\\nFollow the on-screen prompts.\\n\\n\\nTo have others send you encrypted messages, you must give them your public key. To do so:\\nexport your public key (There are three different ways to do this, reference this manual to decide which is best for you.), and send it to the other side. Never distribute your private key.\\nIn the case of the standard UMIACS setup for accepting sensitive information online, such as credit card information, social security number, etc, it is mandatory that we use encrypted messages.

Remember that your webpage is not permanently continued upon your departure from UMIACS.\\nUMIACS currently supports hosting a personal website on the Object Store.\\n\\nUMIACS Object Store\\nThis is the preferred method of hosting a personal website at UMIACS. Please see the UMIACS Object Store (OBJ) Help Page for more information on creating a website within OBJ. Once you create your website in OBJ, you will need to set your directory Home Page to the bucket\\'s URL (the URL that ends in umiacs.io).\\n\\nNexus File Space\\n\\n\\nThis service has been deprecated.\\n\\nThis is primarily a legacy method for users who already have their websites configured this way. If you believe that your circumstances require your personal website to be hosted on this file space, please contact the  Help Desk. (This does not affect existing users who already have websites hosted on the Nexus file space.)\\nYou will need set your directory Home Page attribute to http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~username, where username is your UMIACS username (similar to your personal URL above). You can access your website for editing in two ways:\\n\\nFrom Unix as /fs/www-users/username - and can be remotely accessed via SFTP to a supported UNIX host.\\nFrom Windows as \\\\\\\\umiacs-webftp\\\\www-users\\\\username - and remotely accessed by the same file share over the VPN.\\n\\n\\nAdding A Password Protected Folder To Your Web Space\\n\\n\\nThis method will NOT work in the UMIACS Object Store.\\n\\n1) Create the directory you want to password protect or cd into the directory you want to password protect.\\n2) Create a file called .htaccess ( vi .htaccess) in the directory you wish to password protect.\\n3) In the file you just created, type the following lines \\n\\nAuthUserFile \"/your/directory/here/\".htpasswd\\nAuthName \"Secure Document\"\\nAuthType Basic\\nrequire user username\\n\\nFor example, if you were going to protect the /fs/www-users/username/private directory and you want the required name to be class239, then your file would look like this:\\n\\nAuthUserFile /fs/www-users/username/private/.htpasswd\\nAuthName \"Secure Document\"\\nAuthType Basic\\nrequire user class239\\n\\n4) Create a file called .htpasswd in the same directory as .htaccess. You create this file by typing in htpasswd -c .htpasswd username in the directory area to be protected.\\nIn the example above, the username is class239 so you would type htpasswd -c .htpasswd class239\\nYou will be prompted to enter the password you want. The .htpasswd file will be created in the current directory and will contain an encrypted version of the password.\\nTo later change the username, edit the .htaccess file and change the username. If you want to later change the password, just retype the above line in step 4 and enter the new password at the prompt.\\n\\nRestricting Content based on IP address\\nIt is possible to have pages on your webspace only accessible to clients connecting from certain IP addresses. In order to accomplish this, cd in to the directory you wish to restrict, and edit your .htaccess or httpd.conf file. The example below shows how to make content only viewable to clients connecting from the UMD WiFi in Apache 2.2.\\n\\nSetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For \"^128\\\\.8\\\\.\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+$\" UMD_NETWORK\\nSetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For \"^129\\\\.2\\\\.\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+$\" UMD_NETWORK\\nSetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For \"^192\\\\.168\\\\.\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+$\" UMD_NETWORK\\nSetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For \"^206\\\\.196\\\\.(?:1[6-9][0-9]|2[0-5][0-9])\\\\.\\\\d+$\" UMD_NETWORK\\nSetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For \"^10\\\\.\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+$\" UMD_NETWORK\\nOrder Deny,Allow\\nDeny from all\\nAllow from env=UMD_NETWORK\\n\\nThe SetEnvIF directive will modify one\\'s environment if the specified attribute matches the provided regular expression. In this example, IP addresses that are forwarded from an IP within UMD\\'s IP space are tagged with UMD_NETWORK. Then, all traffic to the example directory is blocked unless it has the UMD_NETWORK tag.

This includes all proxy networks, the vast majority of machines in the labs, and machines connected to the UMIACS VPN - but not a wireless network (e.g., eduroam, umd-guest) alone. \\n\\nGo to Start and search \"\\\\\\\\printers.ad.umiacs.umd.edu\" in the search box.\\n\\nYou will be prompted with a box for authentication if you are not signed into Windows with your UMIACS account (e.g. on a laptop or self-supported machine).  Make sure to prefix \\'UMIACS\\\\\\' to your username.  (For example, if your username was \\'johndoe\\' you would enter \\'UMIACS\\\\johndoe\\' in the username box.)\\nCheck the box for \\'Remember my credentials\\' before clicking OK or you may not be able to add printer queues in the next step.\\n\\nA list of printer queues will appear.  Select your desired printer by double clicking on the queue.\\n\\nWait for the printer driver installation.  This may take a minute or two to complete.\\n\\nOnce done, you can start using the printer.\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\nIf you receive the following error when attempting to add a printer queue, the issue may be that your computer is configured for a higher level of printer security than is default at UMIACS as a result of the PrintNightmare vulnerability.\\n\\n\\nTo resolve this error:\\n\\nClick on the Start menu and type \"cmd\" in the run bar.\\n\\nRight-Click on the cmd button, and select \"Run as Administrator\" - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!\\n\\nSelect \"Yes\" when it asks if you want to allow the following program to make changes.\\n\\nFrom the Command Prompt, run these commands in order:\\nreg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\Printers\\\\PointAndPrint\" /v RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\\nreg add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Print\" /v RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\\nnet stop spooler /y && net start spooler\\n\\nAttempt to add the printer queue again.\\n\\n\\nRemoving a printer queue\\nTo remove a printer queue, open the Start menu and search for and go to Control Panel. Next, click on \"View devices and printers.\" To remove the queue, right click on the printer and select \"Remove device\". If you wish to add the printer back, follow the instructions above.\\n\\n\\nDuplex Printing\\nMany printers in UMIACS support duplex (2 sided) printing. To make the duplex printing default, first make sure the appropriate printer queue is installed via the directions above. Afterwards, go to start, then “Devices and Printers.”\\nOnce the printer has been installed proceed by right clicking on the queue then selecting “Printing preferences.”\\n\\n\\nAfter a few seconds the following menu will come up. Make sure you are on the “Printing Shortcuts” tab and select the “EcoSMART Settings” option then click on okay. This modification will allow you to print 2-sided whenever you choose to use this printer.\\n\\n\\nStore and Print PIN-Protected Jobs\\nPIN-protected jobs provide a way to ensure jobs are not printed until you are ready to pick them up. This can be useful if you have a sensitive job that you want to print on a public printer at UMIACS. Follow the below steps to store a job and then print it at the printer.\\nCreate a stored job\\n\\nFrom the software program, select the Print option.\\nSelect the printer from the list of printers, and then select Properties or Preferences (name varies by software program)\\nClick the Job Storage tab.\\nUnder Job Storage Mode, select Personal Job.\\n\\nIn the drop-down menu under Make Job Private/Secure, select PIN to print, and type in a 4-digit number.\\n\\nNote: You will need to provide the entered PIN (4-digit number) at the printer\\'s control panel.\\n\\n\\nClick the OK button to close the Document Properties/Preferences dialog box. In the Print dialog box, click Print.\\n\\n\\nPrint a stored job\\nAfter you have created a stored job using the instructions above, follow these steps to print from the printer\\'s control panel.\\n\\nFrom the Home screen on the printer control panel, select Print.\\nSelect Print from Job Storage.\\n\\nSelect Choose, and then select the name of the folder where the job is stored.\\n\\nSelect the name of the job, enter your chosen PIN (4-digit number), and click Ok.\\n\\nSelect Print to print the job.\\n\\nNote: The print job is deleted from memory after it prints.\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=WindowsPrinting&oldid=11726\"'),\n",

As security threats have evolved from the operating system to applications we have had to take this step in order to maintain operational security for the Institute. Currently the updates are focused on applications that are exposed to the internet such as web browsers, teleconferencing solutions, Adobe Flash, Java, etc.\\nThe Ivanti Endpoint Manager agent software is currently deployed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as  Enterprise supported Windows laptops and home machines.\\n\\nAutomated Scanning\\nPatches are deployed during the week leading up to the maintenance window. Specifically, they will always be released on the Wednesday that falls between the 9th and the 15th of every month, and typically in the morning.\\n\\nDesktops will scan for updates to be installed every night sometime between 7pm and 9pm. If you are not logged in during those times, the system will automatically install the patches and reboot if necessary. If you remain active on your system during those times, you will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.\\nLaptops will scan for updates to be installed at least once every day (assuming the laptop is powered on). This will only occur when the laptop has an active Internet connection (wired or wireless). You will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.\\n\\n\\nInstallation can be deferred until lock/logoff if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, installation will automatically proceed:\\n\\nDesktops: 24 hours\\nLaptops: 3 hours\\n\\n\\nIf a reboot is required after installation finishes, you will receive another pop up. It is highly suggested to reboot right away due to system instability and vulnerability. However, reboot can be deferred for up to 6 days if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, the machine will automatically reboot:\\n\\nDesktops: 24 hours\\nLaptops: 9 hours\\n\\n\\nIf you interrupt the installation process between when the first patch begins installing and when the last patch finishes installing, Ivanti may ask to reboot before continuing to install the remaining patches next time it pops up. This is by design. If you would like to avoid multiple reboots on a machine that is used intermittently (such as a laptop), we would recommend starting a manual scan just before you stop using the machine for the night and then letting the machine download and apply all patches overnight. See below section for how to do this.\\n\\nManual Scanning\\nThis should only need to be done on laptops or home machines in the event that Ivanti has not had a large enough time window to scan your computer recently, but can be optionally done if you see fit. Please note you will need an active Internet connection for this to work, however you do not need to be on the UMIACS VPN.\\n\\nSearch for \"Security Scan\" from the Start menu and click the result that shows up (should show a shield icon). The scan will begin. Patches will be detected and downloaded.\\nNote: The scan may fail on the \"Checking for other running scanners\" step if Ivanti is already running an invisible scan in the background. If this occurs, wait 10-15 minutes and then retry the scan.\\n\\nAfter all patches have been downloaded, you will be prompted to allow the install to begin.\\n\\nAfter all patches have been installed, you may be prompted to reboot.\\n\\nIf you do not want to reboot immediately, you can click on the \\'Remind me in:\\' drop down menu and click \\'More options...\\'\\n\\nClick the \\'Remind me on\\' radio button and choose a date and time before the deadline (it will tell you what the deadline is).

These accounts can access resources such as GitLab, UMobjstore, Wikis, and other web-based applications. These accounts do not have storage and access to UMIACS workstations, however.\\n\\nHow do I create a Collaborator Account?\\nA UMIACS Account holder has to sponsor the Collaborator Account.   This is done in our UMIACS Requests Application.  This will send an email to the Collaborator to set their details (including a username and password).  Once the Collaborator has created their account, an email will be sent to both the account sponsor and the Collaborator that the account is ready to use.\\n\\nServices Offered\\nCollaborators can access GitLab, the Object Store, as well as other web applications.\\n\\nGitLab\\nGitLab is a source code collaboration software based on Git source control management.  It supports built-in project wikis, code review, and issue tracking for each project.  All Collaborators automatically get GitLab access.  Although Collaborators can modify any of the repos you add them to, they do not get an allocation to create projects of their own.\\n\\nObject Store\\nUMobjstore is the web application component complementing UMobj, the command-line utility used to interact with the Object Store. UMobjstore gives users a convenient interface to our Ceph Object Stores which are distributed across different machines, so that machines can fail and the cluster keep functioning.\\n\\nWikis\\nWikis are great for providing collaborative web spaces. In order to access a particular wiki, a Collaborator will first have to be added to the respective SecGroup.\\n\\nControlling Access to your Collaborators\\nSecurity Groups\\nSecGroup are authentication groups that give PIs the ability to manage which users should have access to different applications that they manage.  They provide fine-grained access control to wikis, source code repositories, and certain web applications.\\n\\nViewing Security Groups\\nYou can view which SecGroups you can grant access to through the directory app: https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/\\n\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Working_with_External_Collaborators&oldid=7984\"')]"

      "Slurm Workload Manager\n",
      "Slurm is an open-source workload manager designed for Linux clusters of all sizes. It provides three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive or non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.\n",

Make sure to replace <USERNAME> with your username, <SUBMISSIONNODE> with the name of the submission node you want to use, and <NODENAME> with the name of the compute node you are assigned. Note that this command will not display any output if the connection is successful due to the included ssh flags. You must also keep this shell window open to be able to connect.\n",

      "Podman is a daemonless container engine alternative to Docker.  We don't support Docker in many of our environments as it grants trivial administrative control over the host the Docker daemon runs on.  Podman on the other hand has the ability to run containers in user namespaces.  This means that for every user name space in the kernel you create the processes within it will map to a new uid/gid range.  For example, if you are root in your container, you will not be uid 0 outside the container, but instead you will be uid 4294000000.\n",
      "We still believe that Apptainer is the best option for running containerized workloads on our clustered based resources.  Podman is a good option for developing the containers to be run via Apptainer or building a deliverable for a funding agency.  Please  contact staff if you would like Podman installed on a workstation or standalone server.  More information on Podman running rootless can be found here.\n",
