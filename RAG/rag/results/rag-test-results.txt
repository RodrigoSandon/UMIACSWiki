Arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.\n\nSLURM offers a variety of ways to run jobs, including interactive shell sessions, batch scripts, and job arrays. Here\'s a brief overview of how to use SLURM:\n\n### Interactive Shell Sessions\n\nTo get an interactive shell on a compute node, use `srun` with the `--pty` argument:\n\n```bash\n$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash\n$ hostname\ntron33.umiacs.umd.edu\n```\n\n### Batch Scripts\n\nTo run a batch script, use `sbatch`:\n\n```bash\n$ sbatch --qos=default --mem=1g --time=1:00:00 helloWorld.sh\nSubmitted batch job 121\n```\n\nA batch script can contain options preceded with `#SBATCH` before any executable commands in the script. For example:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --job-name=helloWorld\n#SBATCH --output=helloWorld.out.%j\n#SBATCH --error=helloWorld.out.%j\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --qos=default\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks=4\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2\n#SBATCH --mem=1g\n\nsrun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &\nsrun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &\nwait\n```\n\n### Job Arrays\n\nTo run a job array, use `sbatch` with the `--array` option:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#SBATCH --job-name=helloWorld\n#SBATCH --output=helloWorld.out.%j\n#SBATCH --error=helloWorld.out.%j\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00\n#SBATCH --qos=default\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks=4\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2\n#SBATCH --mem=1g\n#SBATCH --array=1-10\n\nsrun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &\nsrun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &\nwait\n```\n\n### Requesting Resources\n\nTo request resources, use the following options:\n\n*   `--nodes`: Request a specific number of nodes.\n*   `--ntasks`: Request a specific number of tasks (cores).\n*   `--mem`: Request a specific amount of memory.\n*   `--gres`: Request a specific type and number of GPUs.\n*   `--partition`: Request a specific partition.\n*   `--account`: Request a specific account.\n*   `--qos`: Request a specific QoS.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ srun --pty --qos=medium --gres=gpu:2 nvidia-smi\n```\n\n### Canceling Jobs\n\nTo cancel a job, use `scancel`:\n\n```bash\n$ scancel 255\n```\n\n### Identifying Resources and Features\n\nTo identify resources and features, use `sinfo`:\n\n```bash\n$ sinfo -o "%40N %8c %8m %35f %35G"\n```\n\nTo identify specific information about a node, use `scontrol` with various flags.\n\n### Requesting GPUs\n\nTo request GPUs, use the `--gres` option:\n\n```bash\n$ srun --pty --qos=medium --gres=gpu:2 nvidia-smi\n```\n\n### MPI Example\n\nTo run an MPI job, use `srun` with the `--mpi=pmix` flag:\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=mpi_test\n#SBATCH --nodes=4\n#SBATCH --ntasks=8\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-socket=1\n#SBATCH --time=00:30:00\nsrun --mpi=pmix /nfshomes/username/testing/mpi/a.out\n```\n\nIn summary, SLURM provides a powerful and flexible way to manage resources and run jobs on a Linux cluster. By using the various options and commands available, you can request specific resources, run interactive shell sessions, batch scripts, and job arrays, and cancel jobs as needed.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1003, 'prompt_tokens': 9633, 'total_tokens': 10636, 'completion_time': 1.3373333330000001, 'prompt_time': 1.192787799, 'queue_time': 0.00341738799999991, 'total_time': 2.530121132}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_9cb648b966', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-e5cd18f7-ae74-4c93-a689-8918339440e0-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9633, 'output_tokens': 1003, 'total_tokens': 10636}

Question: Where can I save files?
Answer: content="You have several options to save files, depending on your needs and preferences. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Local data storage**: This is best suited for data that you are actively working on, such as code, results from computational jobs, or files that need to be processed by another desktop-based or server-based application. You can store files on UMIACS' local storage, which can be accessed from different UMIACS-supported hosts and shared with other UMIACS account holders.\n2. **UMIACS' Object Store**: This is best suited for data that is going to remain static, but needs to remain accessible for very long periods of time, such as data referenced by published papers. You can store files in UMIACS' Object Store, which can be accessed via its built-in web interface or compatible clients.\n3. **Cloud data storage**: This is best suited for collaborative data, such as simple or rich text documents, PDF forms, spreadsheets, presentations, pictures, videos, and more. You can use cloud storage services like Google Drive, which can be accessed from anywhere and shared with others.\n\nIn terms of specific locations, you can save files to:\n\n* Your **Network Home Directory Local Storage**, which is accessible via `/nfshomes/<username>` (NFS) or `\\\\isilondata.umiacs.umd.edu\\\\nfshomes\\\\<username>` (CIFS). This storage is backed up nightly and has snapshots enabled for easy user restores.\n* Your **UNIX Local Storage**, which includes directories like `/tmp`, `/scratch0`, `/scratch1`, etc. These directories are not backed up or archived by UMIACS and should not be used for permanent storage.\n* Your **Windows and macOS Local Storage**, which stores user directories on the primary internal drives (C:\\\\Users for Windows, /Users for macOS). These directories are backed up nightly using the Institute's TSM backup system.\n* **Direct-Attached Local Storage**, which includes devices like USB flash drives and USB hard drives. However, these devices are not backed up or archived by UMIACS and are prone to high rates of failure.\n* **Network-Attached Local Storage**, which includes shares like `/fs/<lab>-<purpose>` (i.e., `/fs/cml-models` or `/fs/vulcan-projects`).

Question: What is a scratch directory?
Answer: content='A scratch directory is a type of storage available to users in the Nexus and Vulcan clusters. It is a temporary storage space where users can store data that is not critical or sensitive, and is intended for use during the execution of a job or a short period of time.\n\nScratch directories have the following characteristics:\n\n1. No data protection: Scratch directories do not have snapshots or backups, so data stored in them is not protected against loss or corruption.\n2. No quotas: Scratch directories do not have quotas or limits on the amount of data that can be stored in them.\n3. High performance: Scratch directories are typically stored on fast, local storage devices, making them suitable for high-performance computing applications.\n4. Temporary storage: Scratch directories are intended for temporary storage of data, and data should be staged out of them before the end of a job or a short period of time.\n\nThere are two types of scratch directories available in the Nexus and Vulcan clusters:\n\n1. Network scratch directories: These are available via NFS and are accessible from all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.\n2. Local scratch directories: These are available on each computational node and are typically more performant than network scratch directories.\n\nUsers can request a permanent increase in scratch space up to 400GB without faculty approval, or up to 1TB with faculty approval.

Question: Why isn’t my SLURM job running?
Answer: content="There could be several reasons why your SLURM job isn't running. Here are some possible causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Job is pending**: Check the job status using `squeue -u username` or `squeue --start -u username`. If the job is pending, it may be due to resource availability, priority, or other factors. You can use `scontrol show job <jobid>` to get more information about the job and the reason for its pending status.\n2. **Resource constraints**: Check if the resources you requested are available. You can use `scontrol show partition` to see the available resources in the partition you submitted your job to.\n3. **Account or partition restrictions**: Make sure you have access to the partition and account you're trying to submit to. You can use `show_assoc` to see your account/job QoS combinations and `scontrol show partition` to see the allowed accounts and QoS for each partition.\n4. **Job QoS limits**: Check if you've exceeded the job QoS limits for the partition you're submitting to. You can use `show_qos` to see the available job QoS and their limits.\n5. **Partition QoS limits**: Check if you've exceeded the partition QoS limits for the partition you're submitting to. You can use `show_partition_qos` to see the available partition QoS and their limits.\n6. **Job submission errors**: Check the job submission output for any errors. You can use `sacct -j <jobid>` to see the job submission output.\n7. **Node availability**: Check if the nodes you requested are available. You can use `scontrol show node` to see the available nodes in the partition you submitted your job to.\n\nTo troubleshoot your job, you can try the following:\n\n* Check the job status using `squeue -u username` or `squeue --start -u username`.\n* Use `scontrol show job <jobid>` to get more information about the job and the reason for its pending status.\n* Check the job submission output using `sacct -j <jobid>`.\n* Check the available resources in the partition using `scontrol show partition`.\n* Check the allowed accounts and QoS for each partition using `scontrol show partition`.\n* Check the job QoS limits using `show_qos`.\n* Check the partition QoS limits using `show_partition_qos`.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can contact the UMIACS support team for further assistance." additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 515, 'prompt_tokens': 8222, 'total_tokens': 8737, 'completion_time': 0.686666667, 'prompt_time': 0.595466186, 'queue_time': 0.0034340059999999895, 'total_time': 1.282132853}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f66ccb39ec', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-9bfbb4ca-2315-4aa5-b8df-129566d206a9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8222, 'output_tokens': 515, 'total_tokens': 8737}

Question: How do I check the status of my SLURM job?
Answer: content="You can check the status of your SLURM job using the `squeue` command. This command shows the status of jobs in the queue. You can use the following flags to filter the output:\n\n* `-u username` to show only your jobs (replace `username` with your UMIACS username)\n* `--start` to estimate start time for a job that has not yet started and the reason why it is waiting\n* `-s` to show the status of individual job steps for a job (e.g. batch jobs)\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `squeue` command:\n\n```bash\n$ squeue -u username\n```\n\nThis will show the status of all your jobs in the queue.\n\n```bash\n$ squeue --start -u username\n```\n\nThis will show the estimated start time for each of your jobs that have not yet started, along with the reason why they are waiting.\n\n```bash\n$ squeue -s -u username\n```\n\nThis will show the status of individual job steps for each of your jobs.\n\nYou can also use the `sstat` command to show metrics from currently running job steps. If you don't specify a job step, the lowest job step is displayed.\n\n```bash\n$ sstat --format JobID,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize <$JOBID>.<$JOBSTEP>\n```\n\nThis will show the metrics for the specified job step.\n\nIf you want to check the status of a specific job, you can use the `sacct` command with the `-j` flag to specify the job ID.\n\n```bash\n$ sacct --format JobID,jobname,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize,Elapsed -j <$JOBID>\n```\n\nThis will show the metrics for the specified job." additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 391, 'prompt_tokens': 10980, 'total_tokens': 11371, 'completion_time': 0.521333333, 'prompt_time': 1.243948084, 'queue_time': 0.0037138250000001705, 'total_time': 1.765281417}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_9cb648b966', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-9f9f697b-91c6-4f25-9ba1-68fb13977f73-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10980, 'output_tokens': 391, 'total_tokens': 11371}

Question: Why did my SLURM job fail?
Answer: content="To determine why your SLURM job failed, you can use the `sacct` command with the `--format` option to specify the fields to be shown. You can also use the `scontrol` command to show the job's details.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Run the `sacct` command with the `--format` option to specify the fields to be shown. For example:\n\n`sacct --format JobID,JobName,ExitCode,State,StartTime,EndTime`\n\nThis will show you the job ID, job name, exit code, state, start time, and end time of the job.\n\n2. Look for the `ExitCode` field, which will indicate the reason for the job's failure. The exit code is a numerical value that corresponds to a specific error message. You can refer to the SLURM documentation to understand the meaning of each exit code.\n\n3. If the `ExitCode` field is not sufficient to determine the reason for the job's failure, you can use the `scontrol` command to show the job's details. For example:\n\n`scontrol show job <job_id>`\n\nThis will show you the job's details, including the reason for its failure.\n\n4. If you are still unable to determine the reason for the job's failure, you can try running the `squeue` command with the `--start` option to estimate the start time for the job and the reason why it is waiting.\n\n`squeue --start -u <username>`\n\nThis will show you the job's status, including the estimated start time and the reason why it is waiting.\n\n5. If you are still unable to determine the reason for the job's failure, you can try checking the job's output and error files to see if there are any error messages or warnings that may indicate the reason for the job's failure.\n\nIn general, the `sacct` and `scontrol` commands are useful tools for troubleshooting SLURM job failures. By using these commands, you can determine the reason for the job's failure and take corrective action to prevent similar failures in the future." additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 435, 'prompt_tokens': 5060, 'total_tokens': 5495, 'completion_time': 0.58, 'prompt_time': 0.960718525, 'queue_time': 0.0025740240000000636, 'total_time': 1.540718525}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_9cb648b966', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-481a9be7-53d8-41e1-a620-e27276f0d594-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5060, 'output_tokens': 435, 'total_tokens': 5495}

Question: How do I request an interactive SLURM job?
Answer: content="To request an interactive SLURM job, you can use the `srun` command with the `--pty` argument. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\n$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash\n```\n\nThis will allocate a node for 1 hour with 1 GB of memory and drop you into a bash shell. You can then run commands and interact with the shell as you would on a normal login node.\n\nNote that `--pty` is used to create a pseudo-terminal, which allows you to interact with the shell as if you were logged in directly to the node.\n\nYou can also use the `salloc` command to request an interactive job. Here's an example:\n\n```bash\n$ salloc --qos=default -N 1 --mem=2g --time=01:00:00\n```\n\nThis will allocate a node for 1 hour with 2 GB of memory and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation.
