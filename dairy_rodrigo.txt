5th September 2024:
- Joined class and made initial project proposal

10th September 2024:
- Had more discussion on what the inital project proposal would work

12th September 2024:
- Got project proposal rejected and shifted to UMIACS Wiki project

17th September 2024:
- Prepared my part of the proposal and presentation

19th September 2024:
- Gave presentation

24th September 2024:
- Worked on and finished project proposal report

25th September 2024:
- Was able to run RAGFlow on my local computer but have a bug with parsing docs

26th September 2024:
- Met with Derek to figure out more about what they're looking for

1st October 2024:
- Figured out the problem with my computer being unable to parse

3rd October 2024:
- Learned about Nexus and how to run it

8th October 2024:
- Learned how perceptron works

10th October 2024:
- Learned optimization methods of ML

15th October 2024:
- Reviewed manual questions made

17th October 2024:
- Reviewed vector database chosen and its now working pipeline

22nd October 2024:
- Figured out rest of to do for presentation day: 
    - Make the current RAG pipeline opensourced (use Milvus instead of Redis and Ollama instead of OpenAI)
    - Have RAG pipeline running on the cloud (embedding and inference): GCP storage for vector DBs and compute, will use an emulator to test, VM GPU resources will still be used and paid for
    - Have a basic UI

24th October 2024:
 - Figured out that fine-tuning may not be needed and just prompting that we may need to adjust for RAG pipeline

26th October 2024:
- Running current implementation on open-sourced material
- But can't run it on my local machine, need to host it on the cloud
- Have a VM running on the cloud to run this pipeline
- Test Questions: 
    - List the file systems I can format a hard drive with?
      file:///Users/rodrigosandon/Documents/CMSC/473/UMIACSWiki/dataset/raw_html/BitLocker_PersonalUse.html
- Turns out I need A100s/V100s but none are avaliable

29th October 2024:
- Started making the midterm presentation
- Partially developed a multiclass decision tree

31st October 2024:
- Presented
- Need to come up with figures, how?

Nov 7th 2024:
- Finding a A100 to work with

Nov 13th 2024:
- was able to run RAG on GCP!

    - List the file systems I can format a hard drive with?

Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
Question:     
List the file systems I can format a hard drive 
Answer: with? 

Here is the list of file systems I can format a hard drive with:

1. **NTFS** (NT File System): This is the default file system for Windows operating systems. It supports file sizes up to 256 terabytes, supports file permissions and access control lists (ACLs), and has built-in compression.

2. **FAT32**: This is a file system that supports file sizes up to 4 GB, is widely supported by various operating systems, and is often used for flash drives and other portable storage devices.

3. **HFS+ (Mac OS Extended)**: This is the default file system for macOS operating systems. It supports file sizes up to 8 exabytes, has built-in journaling, and supports file permissions and ACLs.

4. **Ext4**: This is a file system that supports file sizes up to 1 exabyte, has built-in journaling, and

 TODO: 
 - having a token limit on response truncates, but really should be 
    modifying the entire response to make a sensible response within thatlimit
    or set soft limits but it should always try to aim for the simplest yet
    most informative response
 - improve the search algo as it didnt find the right one plus it it keeps
 refinding the same doc (but look into this, want to know what exact chunks
 within each document its grabbing from to know relvancy)
