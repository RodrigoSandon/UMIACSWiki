- Figured out rest of to do for presentation day: 
    - Make the current RAG pipeline opensourced (use Milvus instead of Redis and Ollama instead of OpenAI)
    - Have RAG pipeline running on the cloud (embedding and inference): GCP storage for vector DBs and compute, will use an emulator to test, VM GPU resources will still be used and paid for
    - Have a basic UI

24th October 2024:
 - Figured out that fine-tuning may not be needed and just prompting that we may need to adjust for RAG pipeline
