These are normally important screens to pay attention to on the internet as a whole and UMIACS goes to great lengths to maintain a secure environment for our users. However, it is not cost effective to provide commercial certs for all our public facing certificates. In order to keep costs down we provide a UMIACS CA (certificate authority) that enables your web browser to trust our secure webpages. The following steps explain how to import this certificate based on your preferred web browser.\\n\\nWindows\\n\\nFor most Windows browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer), certificate authorities are handled by Windows itself. These are the steps required to accept the certificate:\\n\\nClick UMIACS Certificate Authority to download the file.\\n\\nOpen the file and click \"Install Certificate\".\\n\\nIn the dialog box opened, click \"Next\".\\n\\nChoose \"Place all certificates in the following store\".\\n\\nChoose \"Browse\", in the dialog box opened, Choose \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" and click \"Ok\".\\n\\nClick \"Next\" and then \"Finish\".\\n\\nIf you get a Security Warning asking if you want to install this certificate, click \"Yes\".\\n\\nYou should receive a success message similar to the following:\\n\\nYou may need to restart your browser for the change to take effect.\\n\\nSafari and Google Chrome (macOS)\\n\\nFor most macOS browsers (excluding Firefox), certificate authorities are handled by macOS itself. This process requires administrator access. If you do not have administrator access and you are using a UMIACS-supported Mac, please contact Staff . Otherwise, here are the steps required to accept the certificate:\\n\\nClick UMIACS Certificate Authority to download the file.\\n\\nOpen Keychain Access (Located in the Others group in Launchpad)\\n\\nGo to the Systems > Certificates\\n\\nOpen the UMIACS Certificate Authority file by double-clicking it (should be located in your downloads folder).\\n\\nEnter your administrator password or use your fingerprint on the dialog box that appears.\\n\\nRight-click the certificate that was just added and select the \"Get Info\" section.\\n\\nSelect \"Always Trust\" option in the \"When using this certificate\" dropdown (\"Trust\" > \"When using this certificate\" > \"Always Trust\")\\n\\nClose the certificate and keychain access window.\\n\\nEnter the administrator credentials to add this certificate for all users of the system\\n\\nYou may need to restart your browser for the change to take effect.\\n\\nOther Browsers (Unix)\\n\\nIf you are using a browser other than Firefox in Unix, the process is more complicated than the above methods and may depend on your particular Unix distribution.

This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus ) and doesn\\'t provide administrative control to users on them. While Docker is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.\\n\\nApptainer was previously branded as Singularity. You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity , however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Overview\\n\\n2 Nexus Containers\\n\\n2.1 Bind Mounts\\n\\n2.2 Shared Containers\\n\\n3 Docker Workflow Example\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nYou can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command. If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on.\\n\\n# apptainer --version\\r\\napptainer version 1.2.5-1.el8\\r\\n\\nApptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images . To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.\\n\\nIf you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories. We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like.\\n\\nexport WORKDIR=/scratch0/$USER\\r\\nexport APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${WORKDIR}/.cache\\r\\nexport APPTAINER_TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/.tmp\\r\\nmkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR\\r\\nmkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIR\\r\\n\\nWe do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file ( SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image.\\n\\n$ apptainer pull cuda12.2.2.sif docker://nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8\\r\\nINFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format\\r\\nINFO:    Starting build...\\r\\nGetting image source signatures\\r\\nCopying blob d5d706ce7b29 done\\r\\nCopying blob b4dc78aeafca done\\r\\nCopying blob 24a22c1b7260 done\\r\\nCopying blob 8dea37be3176 done\\r\\nCopying blob 25fa05cd42bd done\\r\\nCopying blob a57130ec8de1 done\\r\\nCopying blob 880a66924cf5 done\\r\\nCopying config db554d658b done\\r\\nWriting manifest to image destination\\r\\nStoring signatures\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:17  info unpack layer: sha256:25fa05cd42bd8fabb25d2a6f3f8c9f7ab34637903d00fd2ed1c1d0fa980427dd\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:19  info unpack layer: sha256:24a22c1b72605a4dbcec13b743ef60a6cbb43185fe46fd8a35941f9af7c11153\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:19  info unpack layer: sha256:8dea37be3176a88fae41c265562d5fb438d9281c356dcb4edeaa51451dbdfdb2\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:b4dc78aeafca6321025300e9d3050c5ba3fb2ac743ae547c6e1efa3f9284ce0b\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:a57130ec8de1e44163e965620d5aed2abe6cddf48b48272964bfd8bca101df38\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:d5d706ce7b293ffb369d3bf0e3f58f959977903b82eb26433fe58645f79b778b\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:49  info unpack layer: sha256:880a66924cf5e11df601a4f531f3741c6867a3e05238bc9b7cebb2a68d479204\\r\\nINFO:    Creating SIF file...\\r\\n\\n$ apptainer inspect cuda12.2.2.sif\\r\\n...\\r\\nmaintainer: NVIDIA CORPORATION <sw-cuda-installer@nvidia.com>\\r\\nname: ubi8\\r\\norg.label-schema.build-arch: amd64\\r\\norg.label-schema.build-date: Wednesday_24_January_2024_13:53:0_EST\\r\\norg.label-schema.schema-version: 1.0\\r\\norg.label-schema.usage.apptainer.version: 1.2.5-1.el8\\r\\norg.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.bootstrap: docker\\r\\norg.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.from: nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\nNow you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command.\\n\\nPlease note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag.

It will use the default script found at /srv/tensor.py within the image.\\n\\n$ hostname && nvidia-smi -L\\r\\ntron38.umiacs.umd.edu\\r\\nGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-4a0a5644-9fc8-84b4-5d22-65d45ca36506)\\r\\n\\n$ apptainer run --nv /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch/pytorch_1.13.0+cu117.sif\\r\\n99 984.5538940429688\\r\\n199 654.1710815429688\\r\\n299 435.662353515625\\r\\n399 291.1429138183594\\r\\n499 195.5575714111328\\r\\n599 132.3363037109375\\r\\n699 90.5206069946289\\r\\n799 62.86213684082031\\r\\n899 44.56754684448242\\r\\n999 32.466392517089844\\r\\n1099 24.461835861206055\\r\\n1199 19.166893005371094\\r\\n1299 15.6642427444458\\r\\n1399 13.347112655639648\\r\\n1499 11.814264297485352\\r\\n1599 10.800163269042969\\r\\n1699 10.129261016845703\\r\\n1799 9.685370445251465\\r\\n1899 9.391674041748047\\r\\n1999 9.19735336303711\\r\\nResult: y = 0.0022362577728927135 + 0.837898313999176 x + -0.0003857926349155605 x^2 + -0.09065020829439163 x^3\\r\\n\\nBind Mounts\\n\\nTo get data into the container you need to pass some bind mounts . Apptainer containers will not automatically mount data from the outside operating system other than your home directory. Users need to manually bind mounts for other file paths.\\n\\n--bind /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>/<PROJECTNAME>:/mnt\\n\\nIn this example, we will exec an interactive session with GPUs and binding our Nexus scratch directory which allows us to specify the command we want to run inside the container.\\n\\napptainer exec --nv --bind /fs/nexus-scratch/username:/fs/nexus-scratch/username /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch/pytorch_1.13.0+cu117.sif bash\\r\\n\\nYou can now write/run your own pytorch python code interactively within the container or just make a python script that you can call directly from the apptainer exec command for batch processing.\\n\\nShared Containers\\n\\nPortable images called Singularity Image Format or .sif files can be copied and shared. Nexus maintains some shared containers in /fs/nexus-containers . These are arranged by the application(s) that are installed.\\n\\nDocker Workflow Example\\n\\nWe have a pytorch_docker example workflow using our GitLab as a Docker registry. You can clone the repository and further customize this to your needs. The workflow is:\\n\\nRun Docker on a laptop or personal desktop on to create the image, or use Podman on a UMIACS-supported system.\\n\\nTag the image and and push it to your repository (this can be any docker registry)\\n\\nPull the image down onto one of our workstations/clusters and run it with your data.\\n\\n$ apptainer pull pytorch_docker.sif docker://registry.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker\\r\\nINFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format\\r\\nINFO:    Starting build...\\r\\nGetting image source signatures\\r\\nCopying blob 85386706b020 done\\r\\n...\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:58:36  info unpack layer: sha256:b6f46848806c8750a68edc4463bf146ed6c3c4af18f5d3f23281dcdfb1c65055\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:58:43  info unpack layer: sha256:44845dc671f759820baac0376198141ca683f554bb16a177a3cfe262c9e368ff\\r\\nINFO:    Creating SIF file...\\r\\n\\n$ apptainer exec --nv pytorch_docker.sif python3 -c \\'from __future__ import print_function; import torch; print(torch.cuda.current_device()); x = torch.rand(5, 3); print(x)\\'\\r\\n0\\r\\ntensor([[0.3273, 0.7174, 0.3587],\\r\\n        [0.2250, 0.3896, 0.4136],\\r\\n        [0.3626, 0.0383, 0.6274],\\r\\n        [0.6241, 0.8079, 0.2950],\\r\\n        [0.0804, 0.9705, 0.0030]])\\r\\n\\nRetrieved from \" https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Apptainer&oldid=11997 \"\\n\\nNavigation menu\\n\\nThis page was last edited on 13 August 2024, at 17:51.\\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\nAbout UMIACS\\n\\nDisclaimers'),\n",

This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus ) and doesn't provide administrative control to users on them. While Docker is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.\\n\\nApptainer was previously branded as Singularity. You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity , however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Overview\\n\\n2 Nexus Containers\\n\\n2.1 Bind Mounts\\n\\n2.2 Shared Containers\\n\\n3 Docker Workflow Example\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nYou can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command. If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on.\\n\\n# apptainer --version\\r\\napptainer version 1.2.5-1.el8\\r\\n\\nApptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images . To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.\\n\\nIf you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories. We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like.\\n\\nexport WORKDIR=/scratch0/$USER\\r\\nexport APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${WORKDIR}/.cache\\r\\nexport APPTAINER_TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/.tmp\\r\\nmkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR\\r\\nmkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIR\\r\\n\\nWe do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file ( SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image.\\n\\n$ apptainer pull cuda12.2.2.sif docker://nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8\\r\\nINFO:    Converting OCI blobs to SIF format\\r\\nINFO:    Starting build...\\r\\nGetting image source signatures\\r\\nCopying blob d5d706ce7b29 done\\r\\nCopying blob b4dc78aeafca done\\r\\nCopying blob 24a22c1b7260 done\\r\\nCopying blob 8dea37be3176 done\\r\\nCopying blob 25fa05cd42bd done\\r\\nCopying blob a57130ec8de1 done\\r\\nCopying blob 880a66924cf5 done\\r\\nCopying config db554d658b done\\r\\nWriting manifest to image destination\\r\\nStoring signatures\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:17  info unpack layer: sha256:25fa05cd42bd8fabb25d2a6f3f8c9f7ab34637903d00fd2ed1c1d0fa980427dd\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:19  info unpack layer: sha256:24a22c1b72605a4dbcec13b743ef60a6cbb43185fe46fd8a35941f9af7c11153\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:19  info unpack layer: sha256:8dea37be3176a88fae41c265562d5fb438d9281c356dcb4edeaa51451dbdfdb2\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:b4dc78aeafca6321025300e9d3050c5ba3fb2ac743ae547c6e1efa3f9284ce0b\\r\\n2022/10/14 10:31:20  info unpack layer: sha256:a57130ec8de1e44163e965620d5aed2abe6cddf48b48272964bfd8bca101df38\\r]</td>\n",

These are normally important screens to pay attention to on the internet as a whole and UMIACS goes to great lengths to maintain a secure environment for our users. However, it is not cost effective to provide commercial certs for all our public facing certificates. In order to keep costs down we provide a UMIACS CA (certificate authority) that enables your web browser to trust our secure webpages. The following steps explain how to import this certificate based on your preferred web browser.\\n\\nWindows\\n\\nFor most Windows browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer), certificate authorities are handled by Windows itself. These are the steps required to accept the certificate:\\n\\nClick UMIACS Certificate Authority to download the file.\\n\\nOpen the file and click \"Install Certificate\".\\n\\nIn the dialog box opened, click \"Next\".\\n\\nChoose \"Place all certificates in the following store\".\\n\\nChoose \"Browse\", in the dialog box opened, Choose \"Trusted Root Certification Authorities\" and click \"Ok\".\\n\\nClick \"Next\" and then \"Finish\".\\n\\nIf you get a Security Warning asking if you want to install this certificate, click \"Yes\".\\n\\nYou should receive a success message similar to the following:\\n\\nYou may need to restart your browser for the change to take effect.\\n\\nSafari and Google Chrome (macOS)\\n\\nFor most macOS browsers (excluding Firefox), certificate authorities are handled by macOS itself. This process requires administrator access. If you do not have administrator access and you are using a UMIACS-supported Mac, please contact Staff . Otherwise, here are the steps required to accept the certificate:\\n\\nClick UMIACS Certificate Authority to download the file.\\n\\nOpen Keychain Access (Located in the Others group in Launchpad)\\n\\nGo to the Systems &gt; Certificates\\n\\nOpen the UMIACS Certificate Authority file by double-clicking it (should be located in your downloads folder).\\n\\nEnter your administrator password or use your fingerprint on the dialog box that appears.\\n\\nRight-click the certificate that was just added and select the \"Get Info\" section.\\n\\nSelect \"Always Trust\" option in the \"When using this certificate\" dropdown (\"Trust\" &gt; \"When using this certificate\" &gt; \"Always Trust\")\\n\\nClose the certificate and keychain access window.\\n\\nEnter the administrator credentials to add this certificate for all users of the system\\n\\nYou may need to restart your browser for the change to take effect.\\n\\nOther Browsers (Unix)\\n\\nIf you are using a browser other than Firefox in Unix, the process is more complicated than the above methods and may depend on your particular Unix distribution. If you need assistance with this please contact UMIACS Staff .\\n\\nRetrieved from \" https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=AddingUMIACSCertificateAuthority&amp;oldid=11521 \"\\n\\nNavigation menu\\n\\nThis page was last edited on 8 January 2024, at 15:57.\\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\nAbout UMIACS\\n\\nDisclaimers]</td>\n",

       "answer          The GTX 1080 Ti assists with CUDA in containers by providing GPU acceleration when specified correctly through container commands like Apptainer or Podman. To access GPUs inside a container, you need to use specific flags such as `--nv` for Apptainer and ensure that the necessary NVIDIA drivers and libraries are available within the container environment.\\n\\nFor example:\\n- Using Apptainer: `$ apptainer run --nv cuda12.2.2.sif nvidia-smi -L`\\n  This command lists GPU devices inside a container, showing two GTX 1080 Ti GPUs with their respective UUIDs.\\n  \\n- Using Podman: `$ podman run --volume `pwd`/test:/mnt --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d gpudocker python3 /mnt/test_torch.py`\\n  This command runs a Python script that uses CUDA, and it detects the GTX 1080 Ti GPU inside the container.\\n\\nThe knowledge base indicates that when running containers with GPUs in environments like Vulcan compute nodes or local systems, specifying these flags ensures proper device creation and library availability for executing CUDA programs effectively.\n",
