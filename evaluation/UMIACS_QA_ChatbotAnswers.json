      "question": "What is KVM and what type of hardware does it require?",
      "answer": "KVM is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V).    It requires x86 hardware with virtualization extensions.    It requires a modified QEMU.    The kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux as of 2.6.20.    It is a full virtualization solution.    It allows running multiple virtual machines.    It requires local disk space for the system image of the virtual machine.    It allows private virtualized hardware for each virtual machine.    It includes a loadable kernel module and a processor specific module.    It requires a network card, disk, and graphics adapter for each virtual machine.    It is a kernel-based virtual machine.    It is a full virtualization solution.    It requires a modified QEMU.    It includes a kernel component.    It is included in mainline Linux.    It is a kernel-based virtual machine.    It is a full virtualization solution.    It is included in mainline Linux.

      "question": "As of which Linux version is the KVM kernel component included in mainline Linux?",
      "answer": "2.6.20.    The system image for the virtual machine should be on local disk space.  Putting a running virtual machine on networked file space will result in poor performance for both the virtual machine, as well as other users of the filespace.    In order to start using KVM on your machine, UMIACS Staff will first need to install the requisite packages and set a baseline configuration.  Please  contact staff along with a brief explanation of your goals for running a local virtual machine.  Note: Ubuntu requires you to be in the kvm group on the local host.    Once staff has installed the required packages you can then use the program 'virt-manager' to initialize and manager your virtual machines.    This will bring up a graphical interface which can be used to manage various aspects of your virtual machines.  The network that is available is called usermode networking which provides a NAT connection to the outside world.  See below about forwarding ports using qemu-kvm.    This functionality is only available by editing the XML file for your domain directly.  Libvirt has the capability to pass arguments directly to the qemu binary.  First create your VM with virt-manager and then shut it down.  Run in a shell virsh -c qemu:///session which will drop you into the virsh shell.   You can list your VMs both running and off by typing list --all.  Find the name of the VM and type edit NAME where NAME is the name of the VM.    You need to replace the <domain> tag in the first line to:   <domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>    Then you need to insert the following lines directly above the last line which should have the </domain> tag.  In this case the port 2222 will be forwarded to the port 22.   You may specify multiple ports here but each needs its"

(Note: Printing is listed in both sections, but only listed once in the answer)  Also, On-Site Services is a category that includes Network Access, Printing, and others, but the category itself is not a current offering.  Only the items listed under the category are current offerings.  In this case, the items listed under the category are Network Access, Printing, and Scanning.  Therefore, the correct answer is the items listed under the category, not the category itself.  If the category itself was a current offering, then the answer would be On-Site Services.  But it is not, so it is not.  Therefore, the answer is Network Access, Printing, and Scanning.  But the question asks for current offerings listed in the Services/OnSite section, and Printing is listed in the Services/OnSite section, but it is also listed in the Current Offerings section.  Therefore, the answer is Network Access, Printing and Scanning, but it should not include Printing because it is listed in the Current Offerings section.  Therefore, the answer is Network Access and Scanning.  But the question asks for current offerings listed in the Services/OnSite section, and Scanning is not listed in the Current Offerings section.

      "answer": "https:// Example.com/secure/page.    or    https://secure.example.com/ Example URL.    Note that it's not the URL itself that is secure, but the protocol used to access the URL.    A secure URL is one that uses the HTTPS protocol.    Any URL that uses the HTTP protocol is not secure.    Note that some sites may be served over HTTPS but still have a URL that starts with HTTP.    This is because the site's URL is not being updated to reflect the new HTTPS protocol, but the actual data being transferred is still secure.    In such cases, the site's URL may appear as HTTP, but the connection is actually secure.    It's also worth noting that some sites may use a non-standard port number, such as 8443, to serve secure content.    In such cases, the URL may start with HTTPS, but the port number may be different from the standard port 443.    For example, https://example.com:8443/secure/page.    In this case, the connection is still secure, but the port number is non-standard.    Note that some sites may also use a self-signed certificate or a certificate that is not trusted by the user's browser, which can cause the connection to appear as insecure, even though the data being transferred is still secure.    In such cases, the user may see a warning message in their browser indicating that the connection is not secure.    It's worth noting that some sites may use a proxy server or a load balancer to serve secure content, which can also cause the connection to appear as insecure.    In such cases, the user may see a warning message in their browser indicating that the connection is not secure.    It's always a good idea to check the URL of a site to ensure that it starts with HTTPS and that the port number is the standard port 443, to ensure that the connection is secure.

You can access the data from the directory where the project storage was allocated.    Project storage is fully protected. It has snapshots enabled and is backed up nightly.    If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.    Staff will then remove the allocation.    If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.    If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.    If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.    Project storage is available for up to 10TB for up to 180 days.    You can request project based allocations by contacting staff with approval from the Vulcan faculty manager (Dr. Shrivastava).    The data is stored in a read-only dataset storage available at /fs/vulcan-datasets.    The list of Vulcan datasets we currently host can be viewed here.

The hardware base requirements mention that the laptop hardware must meet the following: University Owned Hardware, Business or professional model line from a tier one manufacturer (e.g. Dell, HP, Microsoft), 3+ years OEM warranty/support, Readily available manufacturer diagnostic tools, and Readily available hardware drivers. There is no mention of ARM-based processors.    However, the text does say that other hardware may be considered on a case-by-case basis, subject to staff evaluation.    This implies that ARM-based processors might be considered on a case-by-case basis, but it is not a specific requirement.    It is worth noting that most laptops with ARM-based processors are not typically considered to be business or professional models from a tier one manufacturer, so it is unlikely that such a laptop would be eligible for UMIACS support.    However, this is purely speculative and would depend on the specific laptop and its configuration.    The text does not provide any further information on this topic.    Therefore, the answer to the question is that there is no specific requirement mentioned for computers with ARM-based processors.    The text does not provide any information on this topic, and it would depend on the specific laptop and its configuration.

You must also click on a link to verify your email address after submitting the account request form.  Your PI must also review and approve your account request.  Accounts can take anywhere from a few hours to a day for installation, depending on how quickly your PI approves your account.

In this case, the TA will need to contact staff and staff will advise on the steps.

      "question": "How are SLURM jobs submitted for both interactive and batch jobs?",
      "answer": "SLURM jobs are submitted using the srun command for interactive jobs and the sbatch command for batch jobs.    If you pass srun a normal shell command or a command that executes a script, it will submit a job to run that command on a compute node and then return. The sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes.     If you need to run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with sbatch.    The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to.    The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one \"job step\".    In the batch script, you can pass additional arguments into your sbatch scripts on the command line and reference them as ${1} for the first argument and so on.    The sbatch command also allows you to write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself.    This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times.    You can also use the salloc command to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script.    Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation.    When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.    The scancel command can be used to cancel job allocations or job steps that are no longer needed.    It can be passed individual job IDs or an option to delete all of your jobs or jobs that meet certain criteria."

      "question": "What limitations do jobs in the scavenger partition have?",
      "answer": "Jobs in the scavenger partition have no resource limits per job, but are subject to preemption rules. They are also limited to a maximum wall time per job of 3 days. Additionally, they are limited to 576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM simultaneously across all jobs running with this job QoS.    In the scavenger-aarch64 partition, the total CPU cores and total RAM are 1600 and 281140MB respectively.    You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.    The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again.    Only contains x86_64 architecture nodes in the scavenger partition and aarch64 architecture nodes in the scavenger-aarch64 partition.    This job QoS is paired 1-1 with the scavenger partition.    To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.    Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.    In the scavenger-aarch64 partition, to use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger-aarch64, --account=scavenger, and --qos=scavenger-aarch64 in your submission arguments.    NOTE: These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS.    Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.    For example, in the default non-preemption partition (tron), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition.

      "answer": "None, the text only mentions RHEL8+. However, the RHEL section does mention \"Various versions of gcc compiled from source\". This implies that there are multiple versions, but it does not specify a number.    There is also a mention of Intel compilers for RHEL7.    The Intel section does not mention the number of versions.    However, it does provide a list of paths for different versions of the Intel compilers.    The paths are located in the RHEL8+/Ubuntu section.    There is no information provided for RHEL7.    Therefore, the answer to the question is that there is no information provided for RHEL7.    However, it can be inferred that there are multiple versions of gcc and Intel compilers available for RHEL7.    But the exact number of versions is not specified.

      "question": "What is the path for gcc version 5.4.0?",
      "answer": "/opt/common/bin/gcc-5.4.0.20160609.  Also, /opt/common/bin/gcc-5.4.0.20160609-gfortran-4.9.3.  Note: The exact version may change over time.    To use this compiler, you need to source the script /opt/common/bin/gccvars.csh (for tcsh/csh users) or /opt/common/bin/gccvars.sh (for bash users) and specify the architecture on the command line when sourcing. For 32bit users that is ia32 and for 64bit that is intel64.    Example for a tcsh/csh user using the 64bit gcc-5.4.0.20160609 compiler on a RHEL8+ host:    source /opt/common/bin/gccvars.csh intel64    You can then use the gcc command to compile with the GCC compiler.    Note: This compiler is only available on RHEL8+ hosts.    Also, note that this compiler is not a compiler provided by Intel, but rather a GCC compiler.    Note: The GCC compiler is also available on the login nodes, but it may be slower than the compilers provided by Intel.

Click New if necessary and append the desired path, separated by semicolons. Click Edit and add the path to the end. Close and reopen the Command Prompt to verify the change.  Open a new Command Prompt and type in PATH to verify.  Alternatively, you can simply type PATH in the existing Command Prompt and verify the change.  If the PATH variable has not been modified properly, the updated PATH should not be printed.  If the PATH variable has been modified properly, the updated PATH should be printed.  To append the path to the end of the PATH variable, click Edit, and type the path followed by a semicolon.  If you are unsure about the steps, you can try typing PATH in the Command Prompt to verify that the PATH variable has been modified properly.  You can also try opening a new Command Prompt to verify the change.  If you are still unsure, you can try checking the User Variables for <username> to see if the PATH variable has been modified properly.  If it has not, you can try clicking New and putting PATH for the Variable name.  Then click Edit and append the location you are trying to add.  Different paths are separated by semicolons.  To verify that the PATH variable has been modified properly, open a new Command Prompt and type in PATH.  The updated PATH should be printed.
