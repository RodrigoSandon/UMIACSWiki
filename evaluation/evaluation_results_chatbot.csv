https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/KVM,What is KVM and what type of hardware does it require?,"KVM is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V).    It requires x86 hardware with virtualization extensions.    It requires a modified QEMU.    The kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux as of 2.6.20.    It is a full virtualization solution.    It allows running multiple virtual machines.    It requires local disk space for the system image of the virtual machine.    It allows private virtualized hardware for each virtual machine.    It includes a loadable kernel module and a processor specific module.    It requires a network card, disk, and graphics adapter for each virtual machine.    It is a kernel-based virtual machine.    It is a full virtualization solution.    It requires a modified QEMU.

https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/KVM,As of which Linux version is the KVM kernel component included in mainline Linux?,"2.6.20.    The system image for the virtual machine should be on local disk space.  Putting a running virtual machine on networked file space will result in poor performance for both the virtual machine, as well as other users of the filespace.    In order to start using KVM on your machine, UMIACS Staff will first need to install the requisite packages and set a baseline configuration.  Please  contact staff along with a brief explanation of your goals for running a local virtual machine.  Note: Ubuntu requires you to be in the kvm group on the local host.    Once staff has installed the required packages you can then use the program 'virt-manager' to initialize and manager your virtual machines.    This will bring up a graphical interface which can be used to manage various aspects of your virtual machines.  The network that is available is called usermode networking which provides a NAT connection to the outside world.  See below about forwarding ports using qemu-kvm.    This functionality is only available by editing the XML file for your domain directly.  Libvirt has the capability to pass arguments directly to the qemu binary.  First create your VM with virt-manager and then shut it down.  Run in a shell virsh -c qemu:///session which will drop you into the virsh shell.   You can list your VMs both running and off by typing list --all.  Find the name of the VM and type edit NAME where NAME is the name of the VM.    You need to replace the <domain> tag in the first line to:   <domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>    Then you need to insert the following lines directly above the last line which should have the </domain> tag.  In this case the port 2222 will be forwarded to the port 22.   You may specify multiple ports here but each needs its",0.7569311857223511

Only the items listed under the category are current offerings.  In this case, the items listed under the category are Network Access, Printing, and Scanning.

Note that it's not the URL itself that is secure, but the protocol used to access the URL.    A secure URL is one that uses the HTTPS protocol.    Any URL that uses the HTTP protocol is not secure.    Note that some sites may be served over HTTPS but still have a URL that starts with HTTP.    This is because the site's URL is not being updated to reflect the new HTTPS protocol, but the actual data being transferred is still secure.    In such cases, the site's URL may appear as HTTP, but the connection is actually secure.    It's also worth noting that some sites may use a non-standard port number, such as 8443, to serve secure content.    In such cases, the URL may start with HTTPS, but the port number may be different from the standard port 443.    For example, https://example.com:8443/secure/page.    In this case, the connection is still secure, but the port number is non-standard.    Note that some sites may also use a self-signed certificate or a certificate that is not trusted by the user's browser, which can cause the connection to appear as insecure, even though the data being transferred is still secure.    In such cases, the user may see a warning message in their browser indicating that the connection is not secure.    It's worth noting that some sites may use a proxy server or a load balancer to serve secure content, which can also cause the connection to appear as insecure.    In such cases, the user may see a warning message in their browser indicating that the connection is not secure.    It's always a good idea to check the URL of a site to ensure that it starts with HTTPS and that the port number is the standard port 443, to ensure that the connection is secure.

This implies that ARM-based processors might be considered on a case-by-case basis, but it is not a specific requirement.

However, RHEL8 is a 64-bit operating system.  It also mentions ""third party clients"" but does not specify their architecture.  However, it is likely that most third-party clients are 64-bit as well.  There is no explicit mention of 32-bit clients, but it is likely that they are not supported.  If you need to use a 32-bit client, you should contact UMIACS staff for more information.  They may be able to provide more information or assist you in finding a solution.  However, based on the provided text, it is likely that 32-bit clients are not supported.  It is always best to check with the vendor or provider of the software or service to confirm their support for 32-bit clients.  In this case, the text does not provide any information that would suggest 32-bit clients are supported.  It is possible that they may be supported, but it is not explicitly stated.

https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Nexus,How are SLURM jobs submitted for both interactive and batch jobs?,"SLURM jobs are submitted using the srun command for interactive jobs and the sbatch command for batch jobs.    If you pass srun a normal shell command or a command that executes a script, it will submit a job to run that command on a compute node and then return. The sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes.     If you need to run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with sbatch.    The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to.    The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one ""job step"".    In the batch script, you can pass additional arguments into your sbatch scripts on the command line and reference them as ${1} for the first argument and so on.    The sbatch command also allows you to write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself.    This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times.    You can also use the salloc command to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script.    Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation.    When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.    The scancel command can be used to cancel job allocations or job steps that are no longer needed.    It can be passed individual job IDs or an option to delete all of your jobs or jobs that meet certain criteria.",0.28903713822364807

They are also limited to a maximum wall time per job of 3 days. Additionally, they are limited to 576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM simultaneously across all jobs running with this job QoS.    In the scavenger-aarch64 partition, the total CPU cores and total RAM are 1600 and 281140MB respectively.    You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.    The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again.

To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.    Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.    In the scavenger-aarch64 partition, to use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger-aarch64, --account=scavenger, and --qos=scavenger-aarch64 in your submission arguments.    NOTE: These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS.    Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.
