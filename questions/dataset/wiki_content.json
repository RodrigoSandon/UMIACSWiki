We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like. We do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file ( SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image. Now you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command. Please note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag. Nvidia has a very specific driver and libraries that are required to run CUDA programs, so this is to ensure that all appropriate devices are created inside the container and that these libraries are made available in the container .",

Choose the first option ( not the command line interface version). If you are using a UMIACS-supported workstation, please contact UMIACS Staff [/umiacs/index.php/HelpDesk] UMIACS Staff to install this on your machine.  Insert your YubiKey into any USB slot on the machine you wish to use for encryption and launch the personalization tool. Select Static Password at the top and then Advanced.  Select Configuration Slot 2(*) and change the password length to 48 chars. Then click all three Generate buttons in order to generate the identities and the secret key and finally Write Configuration. Click cancel (do not save) on the prompt that pops up to save the .csv file, as this saves the Public Identity, Private Identity, and Secret Key in plaintext. Ensure that \"YubiKey has been successfully configured\" is output in the Results window, and then click Exit in the top right to exit the tool. (*) NOTE: The YubiKey token has two configuration slots. These are nearly functionally identical, but the key difference for the sake of this document is that Slot 2 requires you to hold the sensor on the device down for 2 seconds in order to activate, whereas Slot 1 instantaneously activates when you touch the sensor. We recommend using Slot 2 so that you do not mistakenly emit the password configured below. If you are already using Slot 2 on your YubiKey, slot 1 can still be used.   Insert your portable hard drive into any USB slot and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.  Expand Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go by clicking the arrow on the right and then click Turn on BitLocker on the portable hard drive.  BitLocker will initialize for a few seconds and then pop up with a menu asking how you want to unlock the drive. Choose Use a password to unlock the drive and physically touch the YubiKey's sensor for 3 seconds to get it to output the password you configured previously in each password field.  The menu should automatically advance to asking how you want to back up the recovery key. The recovery key is the only way to get into the encrypted drive if you lose the YubiKey. We strongly recommend the Save to a file option for reasons that we will get into. If you choose to print out the recovery key, store it somewhere safe such as a safe deposit box.  Plug in your first USB flash drive and choose to save the file on it.  If you previously had anything saved on your portable hard drive before formatting it as part of the prerequisites, choose to Encrypt entire drive. This is the safest way to ensure everything on the drive is protected. Otherwise (if this is a brand new blank drive), leave the default option of Encrypt used disk space only.  Leave the default of Compatible mode to better ensure the files on the encrypted drive will be readable from other devices (which may be running earlier versions of Windows) if need be.  Continue through the menus and finally choose to Start encrypting.  BitLocker will begin encrypting and a separate window will pop up to show you the status. This step will either take a long time if you chose to Encrypt entire drive, or complete very quickly if you chose to Encrypt used disk space only. You do not have to wait for encryption to complete to proceed with the remaining steps, but you do need to wait for encryption to complete before disconnecting the portable hard drive from the machine.  Download the portable version of KeePassXC Password Manager [https://keepassxc.org/download/] KeePassXC Password Manager . Then extract it to your USB flash drive.  Launch KeePassXC.exe from the extracted folder and choose to Create new database.  Choose descriptive phrases for the Database Name and Description and click Continue.  Leave all the options on the next menu at default unless you know what you are doing and have good reason to change them and click Continue.  Choose a memorable password and click Done.  Choose to save the file on your USB flash drive.  In your newly created database, choose to Add a new entry from the top pane.  Make the Title something memorable. Open the recovery key text file saved earlier, copy the Identifier into the Username field and the Recovery Key into the Password/Repeat fields. Leave some descriptive text in the Notes section to help clarify which fields are which of the BitLocker attributes. Click OK and then exit out of the database back on the main menu.  Delete the recovery key text file permanently (NOT the database file you just created). If you leave the recovery key text file on the USB drive, your encrypted portable hard drive is only as secure as that USB flash drive is, rather than needing both the USB flash drive and the password for the database to access the recovery key.  (Optional) Copy the contents of the first USB flash drive onto one or more additional USB flash drives to safeguard against loss of both the YubiKey and any single USB flash drive.  Clearly label the USB flash drive(s) and store them somewhere secure, such as a safe deposit box. If you have multiple USB flash drives, store them separately.  Your portable hard drive is now securely BitLocker-encrypted, with one or more USB drives serving as access to the recovery key.",

Once a request for a student has been created from this email address, the student receives an email with a URL including a token that is only good for 7 days. Once they click this URL, they will be taken to a page to redeem their account by entering some information about themselves and selecting a password for their account. If the student does not redeem their account, Faculty/TAs can go into the student's class account request in the app and renew their token.  This will invalidate the old token and issue a new token and then send a new email for account redemption.  Accounts that are redeemed will show up as pending in the Accounts Installed section of the class dashboard.  UMIACS Technical Staff will install class accounts that have been redeemed once per business day.  Once the account(s) are installed, they will be listed as installed on the class dashboard.

This issue is further compounded in the context of cluster jobs, as a single user can generate hundreds if not thousands of jobs all trying to access the same network fileserver.  By utilizing the local disks on the compute nodes, you effectively distribute the data access load and reduce the load on the central fileserver. Following these best practices isn't just about being a good neighbor however, they will also improve the performance of your jobs.  To further illustrate this issue, consider a service like Netflix.  While Netflix invests heavily in their data storage and supporting network, if they allowed their customers to access it directly it would quickly reach capacity resulting in performance degradation for all users.  In order to accommodate this Netflix distributes it's data into various caching tiers, which are much closer to the end user.  This distribution evens the load across multiple different devices, increasing the performance and availability for all users.  While UMIACS obviously does not operate at the same scale as Netflix, the same issues are still present within the compute infrastructure.  Processing data that resides on local disk space reduces the load on the central file server and improves the performance of the process. ",

Utilizing archive files provide the following benefits: Faster data transfers  Reduced data size  Easier data management. Practically every filesystem in existence has limitations in it's ability to handle large numbers of small files.  By grouping large collections of small files into a single archive file we reduce the impact of this limitation, as well as improve the efficiency of data storage when combined with techniques such as compression.  Another advantage manifests when transferring data over the network.  In order to transfer a file a connection to the remote location has to be established and closed for each file, which can add significant overhead when dealing with large numbers of files.  When the files are collected into a single archive file we reduce the number of connections that are created and destroyed, and focus more on streaming data. Common utilities for creating archive files are tar and zip . ",

Select the source you'd like to route to the computer via the \"Shared Media\" option on the Crestron control panel. This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.  Download (windows zip file) [https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases] Download (windows zip file) and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.  Set up video. Click the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.  Ensure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called 'AV Bridge'.  Click OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.  If the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack's default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.  Ensure audio settings look OK. The default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.  Keep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.  Set up either streaming, recording, or both as follows. Streaming : Go to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).  Locate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this. YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard [https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard] https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard , near the bottom  Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings [https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings] https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings , at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.  Enter your key and hit OK.  Click Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom. Recording : Go to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive. We have observed that using external HDDs may introduce dropped frames due to encoding lag because of I/O bottlenecks.  Click Start Recording under the Control pane at the bottom.",

This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.  Download (windows zip file) [https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases] Download (windows zip file) and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.  Set up video. Click the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.  Ensure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called 'AV Bridge'.  Click OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.  If the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack's default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.  Ensure audio settings look OK. The default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.  Keep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.  Set up either streaming, recording, or both as follows. Streaming : Go to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).  Locate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this. YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard [https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard] https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard , near the bottom  Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings [https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings] https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings , at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.  Enter your key and hit OK.  Click Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom. Recording : Go to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive.

The only main difference between the two is that HDMI transfers sound natively, while with VGA you will need to connect an additional 3.5mm audio cable. With either approach, the general steps are as follows:  Connect your cable of choice to the device you wish to display on the screen. You may need an adapter if you are using a laptop.   Connect the other end of the cable to the wall port (usually located opposite of the TV).  If you do not see your device automatically appearing on the TV, you may need to turn on the TV or adjust the input of the TV (both done using the remote). If you do not currently have a remote for your TV, you can get one from the UMIACS Help Desk.  To adjust the input of the TV, click the source button on the remote, located between the volume and channel buttons, and select the proper input named HDMI 1.   Once you connect your device, there are different display modes that can be chosen. Some operating systems may have additional nonstandard options which are described on the individual display mode pages listed below.

You can now navigate to and click on a picture to make it display fullscreen. You may notice that it automatically starts playing a slideshow if you have more than one picture in the same directory. You can click the play and pause buttons on the remote to toggle this behavior.   To change the slideshow speed, orientation, and transition effects, click the options dropdown in the top right of the file explorer. There you can see the many options available to be changed.  The TVs have ~4.5 GB of space available for you to upload files to from your USB. To do this, follow these steps:  Navigate to the options menu in the top right and select the Send option.  Select all of the images you want to be stored onto the TV.  When you are done selecting, click the Send button located in the top right and click Internal Memory from the dropdown. When a popup box appears, click Start.  Once the process completes, you can navigate back to the internal memory through the dropdown in the top left and you will see all of the pictures you selected are now there.

The main difference between the two is that offline scans work outside of your computer's operating system. This can provide an alternate means for detecting and mitigating threats that may use various tactics to hide from your installed antivirus. On the other hand, online scanners can detect most problems while also being easier to use. Most online scanners have better interfaces than their offline counterparts, and they are usually easier to set up and run. Thus, the best way to remove malware or a virus would be to first try an online scanner and see if the issue still persists. If the online scanner did not fix the problem, then you should try an offline scanner. Below are some links to various online and offline scanners.",

Choose either Malware scan or Full computer scan. Malware scan: Searches common places where malware can be found. This makes it faster, but it may miss some hidden malware.  Full computer Scan: Scans all internal/external hard drives for malware. This makes it more thorough than the malware scan, but it can take a long time to complete.  After choosing an option, another screen should pop up that shows the progress of the scan.   Once the scan is complete, it will provide a report stating whether any malware was found.

To view partition QoS, use the show_partition_qos command. If you want to see all partition QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_partition_qos --all command. NOTE : These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS (i.e., they are not in the AllowQos field for their respective partition). Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used. For example, in the default non-preemption partition ( tron ), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition. Lab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two \"TRES\" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition. All partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill [https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html#backfill] backfill issues with the SLURM scheduler. If you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an \"outer submission script\" that repeatedly attempts to run an \"inner submission script\" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval. An example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an array job [/umiacs/index.php/SLURM/ArrayJobs] array job , and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less. It is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux [/umiacs/index.php/Tmux] Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.",

Renewal is not guaranteed to be available due to limits on the amount of total storage. Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you are still in need of the storage allocation.  If renewal is available, you can renew for up to another 270 TB days with reapproval from the original faculty approver. If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.  If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible. If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.  If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.",

If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please contact staff [/umiacs/index.php/HelpDesk] contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on. Apptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images [https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/docker_and_oci.html] Docker images .  To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman [/umiacs/index.php/Podman] Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host. If you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories.  We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like. We do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file ( SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image. Now you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command. Please note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag. Nvidia has a very specific driver and libraries that are required to run CUDA programs, so this is to ensure that all appropriate devices are created inside the container and that these libraries are made available in the container .",

Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:   Standalone CML cluster submission command  Nexus cluster submission command   srun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash   srun --partition=cml-dpart --qos=cml-medium --account=cml-tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash    srun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash   srun --partition=cml-cpu --qos=cml-cpu --account=cml --pty bash    srun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash   srun --partition=cml-scavenger --qos=cml-scavenger --account=cml-scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash  CML users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on CML nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the cml-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all cml## nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named cml . Please note that the CML compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. CML users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the cml-scavenger partition (i.e., all cml- partition jobs (other than cml-scavenger ) can preempt both cml-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and cml-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).",

The actual submission hosts are: nexusvulcan00.umiacs.umd.edu  nexusvulcan01.umiacs.umd.edu All partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone Vulcan cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named vulcan in the standalone cluster (it is also named just vulcan in Nexus). Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:   Standalone Vulcan cluster submission command  Nexus cluster submission command   srun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash   srun --partition=vulcan-dpart --qos=vulcan-medium --account=vulcan-abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash    srun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash   srun --partition=vulcan-cpu --qos=vulcan-cpu --account=vulcan --pty bash    srun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash   srun --partition=vulcan-scavenger --qos=vulcan-scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash  Vulcan users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on Vulcan nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the vulcan-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all vulcan## in aggregate nodes plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan . Please note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger ) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).",

Make sure to choose a bucket name carefully since this will be part of the web URL.  [/umiacs/index.php/File:Bucket_settings01.jpg]  Upload your index.html file and optional error.html file (and any other required files for your website) on the bucket that you just created.  Once the files are uploaded, click on Bucket Settings  On the settings page, click on the blue Make Public button.  [/umiacs/index.php/File:Bucket_settings.jpg]  Under Website Hosting, enter the name of your index.html (and optionally error.html) file and hit Submit.  Second Method (Using the UMobj CLI):  Set up your environment variables [/umiacs/index.php/UMobj] Set up your environment variables .  On the shell enter mkobj <bucket_name> to create a bucket. Your bucket name must be unique. You can enter lsobj -l to see the existing buckets.  Copy all the required files to the bucket: cpobj [source_directory]/file_name <bucket_name>: . For example, cpobj /fs/www-users/jayid-test/index.html jayid-test:  Create a web configuration for your bucket: webobj -m create -c website --index=index.html --error=error.html <bucket_name>  Make your bucket public: chobj -m public <bucket_name> Third Method (Using a Graphical S3 Client): Since there are many different graphical clients available, we won't be able to cover detailed instructions for all of them. The instruction below only applies to Cyberduck. Please refer to S3Clients [/umiacs/index.php/S3Clients] S3Clients to download and install Cyberduck.  Log into Cyberduck using the instruction from the previous step.  Once logged in, right-click > New Folder... . Give a unique name to your bucket.  Right-click on the bucket you just created, and click on Upload... . You can upload multiple files at once.  Once all the files are uploaded, right-click on the same bucket, and click on info .  Under the Distribution (CDN) tab make sure to leave a checkmark next to Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution .  Next, click on the drop-down menu next to Index File and select your index.html file (or whatever file you're using as your index file).

                "content": "Partition QoS are used to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user (MaxTRESPU) or per group (GrpTRES). To view partition QoS, use the show_partition_qos command. If you want to see all partition QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_partition_qos --all command. NOTE : These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS (i.e., they are not in the AllowQos field for their respective partition). Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used. For example, in the default non-preemption partition ( tron ), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition. Lab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two \"TRES\" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition. All partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill [https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html#backfill] backfill issues with the SLURM scheduler. If you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an \"outer submission script\" that repeatedly attempts to run an \"inner submission script\" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval. An example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an array job [/umiacs/index.php/SLURM/ArrayJobs] array job , and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less. It is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux [/umiacs/index.php/Tmux] Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.",

See Printing [/umiacs/index.php/Printing] Printing for more details specific to your OS.

The naming scheme is as follows: All color printers begin with a \"c\".  Black & white is the default so nothing extra is needed.  Then either \"ps\" for a PostScript-enabled queue or \"pcl\" for a Printer Command Language-enabled queue will appear.  PostScript and PCL are types of printer drivers.  If you are unsure what this means, use \"ps\" for PostScript.  PCL drivers may not always be available.  Then add the building number and a dash (\"-\"). E.g. add \"432-\" for IRB, \"115-\" for AVW, or \"224-\" for ATL.  Then add the room number. E.g. If the printer is in room 3208, add \"3208\".  Some examples: ps432-3208 is a black & white printer in Iribe 3208.  cps224-3261 is a color printer in Atlantic 3261.",

With RDP, you can control your Windows desktop environment through a graphical user interface. Mouse and keyboard movements are transferred over a network to a Windows host running an RDP server, which sends screen refreshes back. To access an RDP enabled machine, you must be on the UMIACS physical network or VPN [/umiacs/index.php/VPN] VPN . You must also be authorized to access and remotely control the host you are requesting. If a remote session is active, it is not possible for another user to log onto the console in-person. Attempting to use RDP when a computer is in use by another user could force the existing user to logoff and lose their work. You should always quit RDP by logging off of the remote computer.

You can use scontrol show job <jobid> to get all the parameters for your job to help identify why your job is not running. Some common ones are as follows: Resources - The cluster does not currently have the resources to fit your job in your selected partition.  Priority - The cluster has reserved resources for higher priority [/umiacs/index.php/SLURM/Priority] priority jobs in your selected partition.  QOSMax*PerUser or QOSMax*PerUserLimit - The quality of service (QoS) your job is requesting to use has some limit per user (CPU, mem, GRES, etc.).  Use show_qos and show_partition_qos to identify the limit(s) and then use scontrol show job <jobid> for each of your jobs running in that QoS to see the resources they are currently consuming.  AssocGrpBilling - The SLURM account you are using has a limit on the overall billing amount available in total for the account.  Use sacctmgr show assoc account=<accountname> where user= to identify the limit, replacing <accountname> with the account you are submitting your job with.  You can see all jobs running under the account and their billing values by running squeue -A <accountname> -O \"JobId:.18 ,Partition:.9 ,Name:.8 ,UserName:.8 ,StateCompact:.2 ,TimeUsed:.10 ,NumNodes:.6 ,ReasonList:45 ,tres-alloc:80\" . The billing value will be part of the tres-alloc string for each job.  ReqNodeNotAvail - None of the nodes that could run your job (based on requested partition/resources) currently have the resources to fit your job.  Alternatively, if you also see Reserved for maintenance , there is a reservation in place (often for a maintenance window [/umiacs/index.php/MonthlyMaintenanceWindow] maintenance window ).  You can see the current reservations by running scontrol show reservation .  Often the culprit is that you have requested a TimeLimit that will conflict with the reservation.  You can either lower your TimeLimit such that the job will complete before the reservation begins, or leave your job to wait until the reservation completes.

Some common command line arguments are listed below and full documentation of all available options is available in the man page for srun , which can be accessed by running man srun . It is important to understand that srun is an interactive command. By default input to srun is broadcast to all compute nodes running your process and output from the compute nodes is redirected to srun . This behavior can be changed; however, srun will always wait for the command passed to finish before exiting, so if you start a long running process and end your terminal session, your process will stop running on the compute nodes and your job will end .

This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one \"job step\". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python [/umiacs/index.php/Python] Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node. Since srun is blocks until the command finishes, we use the '&' operator to background the process so that both job steps can run at once; however, this means that we then need to use the wait command to block processing until all background processes have finished. Another useful thing to know is that you can pass additional arguments into your sbatch scripts on the command line and reference them as ${1} for the first argument and so on.",

In SLURM, GPUs are considered \"generic resources\" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:# . If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec'd GPU. Note that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs. Please note that your job will only be able to see/access the GPUs you requested. If you only need 1 GPU, please only request 1 GPU. The others on the node (if any) will be left available for other users. As with all other flags, the --gres flag may also be passed to sbatch [#sbatch] sbatch and salloc [#salloc] salloc rather than directly to srun [#srun] srun .",

                "content": "UMIACS has rolled out multi-factor authentication requirements when using SSH [/umiacs/index.php/SSH] SSH to connect to our public-facing hosts to provide better account and data security. Public-facing hosts are hosts that are reachable via the Internet (e.g. via ping [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)] ping ) without first establishing a connection to our VPN [/umiacs/index.php/VPN] VPN . If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border). SSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and public key authentication [/umiacs/index.php/SSH/Keys] public key authentication . Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo [/umiacs/index.php/Duo] Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo [/umiacs/index.php/Duo] Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor] U2F hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically. Other hardware tokens such as a YubiKey [https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/] YubiKey or Duo's own hardware token [https://guide.duo.com/tokens] Duo's own hardware token will still work.",

In the below example, we are also SSH-ing to a Nexus [/umiacs/index.php/Nexus] Nexus node e.g. ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu  Once you enter the command (if using a native terminal) or start the session (PuTTY or other terminal emulators), you will be presented with the following prompt: Enter your UMIACS password here (the same as if you were using interactive password authentication to connect to an internal host).

If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border). SSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and public key authentication [/umiacs/index.php/SSH/Keys] public key authentication . Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo [/umiacs/index.php/Duo] Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo [/umiacs/index.php/Duo] Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor] U2F hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically.

The SetGID directory bit will force all files created under that directory to have the same GID.  Any directories created will also be given the same GID and the SetGID bit so that the same policy is applied at the next level of directory down. Before we give an example of how to use the sticky bit please see the documentation about umask [/umiacs/index.php/Umask] umask .  SetGID will only work on the GID and the setting a sticky bit and will not change any other permissions.  By default the umask is 022 and is a bit too restrictive for the use of SetGID effectively.  (002 or 007 will be the appropriate setting depending if you want Others to be able to read/execute or not) First an example of what our default group is and what other groups we belong to: Now we have created a directory called staff that we want to share with the umadmin group (which is not my default group) We are going to set the new group to umadmin and set rwxrwxr-x permissions.  Then finally we will add the SetGID bit. Now you can see we have a directory that is correctly set up, We are going to use umask [/umiacs/index.php/Umask] umask of 002 since we want to allow others to read the files. We are going to now create a test file and test directory, Now as you can see we have the correct groups and permissions being used to create both files directories,",

This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one \"job step\". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python [/umiacs/index.php/Python] Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node. Since srun is blocks until the command finishes, we use the '&' operator to background the process so that both job steps can run at once; however, this means that we then need to use the wait command to block processing until all background processes have finished. Another useful thing to know is that you can pass additional arguments into your sbatch scripts on the command line and reference them as ${1} for the first argument and so on.",

These arguments are: --partition : Only include nodes in the specified partition(s).  --account : Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified account(s).  --qos : Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified QoS(es).  --cpus : Only include nodes with at least this many CPUs free.  --mem : Only include nodes with at least this much memory free.

In SLURM, GPUs are considered \"generic resources\" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:# . If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec'd GPU. Note that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs. Please note that your job will only be able to see/access the GPUs you requested. If you only need 1 GPU, please only request 1 GPU. The others on the node (if any) will be left available for other users. As with all other flags, the --gres flag may also be passed to sbatch [#sbatch] sbatch and salloc [#salloc] salloc rather than directly to srun [#srun] srun .",

If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please contact staff [/umiacs/index.php/HelpDesk] contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on. Apptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images [https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/docker_and_oci.html] Docker images .  To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman [/umiacs/index.php/Podman] Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host. If you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories.  We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like. We do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file ( SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image. Now you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command. Please note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag.

However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named vulcan in the standalone cluster (it is also named just vulcan in Nexus).

It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan . Please note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger ) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).",
