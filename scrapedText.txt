UMIACS'  Object Store has the ability to host websites. On the settings page for each bucket, there is a section allowing you to specify a configuration for a website hosted in your bucket. You can choose keys located in your bucket to act as the index file (what will be displayed when someone visits your website) and the error file (what will be displayed when an error is encountered loading your website). These settings can be updated at any time.
Because hosting a website through your bucket requires others to have access to any keys associated with your website, setting up a website configuration will automatically set the visibility of your bucket to public and remove the bucket level ACLs. You will not be able to set the bucket back to private without first removing the website configuration, which can be done on the bucket settings page.
Note: The Object Store only has the capability to support static content and client-side scripting in bucket websites.

︗Hosting a Website
Hosting a website in OBJ is quite easy and can be done in a few simple steps. There are three different ways you can set up your OBJ bucket to host a static website.
First Method (Using the Web Interface):

Log into OBJ(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/) and create a bucket. Make sure to choose a bucket name carefully since this will be part of the web URL. The image depicts the user interface of the OBJbox, specifically within the context of managing a bucket named "jayid-test." The top portion of the interface includes a search bar labeled "Search" indicating users can look for files or directories within their bucket. Below this, there is a navigation section showcasing several buttons, which include "New Directory," "Upload File," and "Bucket Settings." The "Upload File" button is prominently highlighted with an orange circle around it, drawing attention to its function. The interface maintains a clean, modern design with a white background and colorful accent bars, suggesting a user-friendly experience for managing files and configurations related to web hosting. The overall arrangement indicates an organized space for users to interact with their stored data seamlessly.
Upload your index.html file and optional error.html file (and any other required files for your website) on the bucket that you just created.
Once the files are uploaded, click on Bucket Settings
On the settings page, click on the blue Make Public button. The image depicts a user interface screen for managing a bucket named "jayid-test" in an Object Storage system. The layout includes a header that displays the bucket name and its usage statistics, indicating 0 objects and 0 bytes used, along with the owner's username. 

The central section highlights the visibility options with a large blue button labeled "Make Public," which is accompanied by two arrows pointing towards it, emphasizing its importance. Below this, there are two input fields under the "Website Hosting" section. The first is labeled "Key for Index file," pre-filled with "index.html," and the second, "Key for Error page (optional)," is left blank for user input. 

To the right, there’s an informational text box explaining that by configuring the bucket for website hosting, it will become publicly accessible at a specified URL. The interface uses a modern design with a clean white background and minimal color accents, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation for users. The overall composition indicates a straightforward setup process for web hosting within the Object Storage platform.
Under Website Hosting, enter the name of your index.html (and optionally error.html) file and hit Submit.

Second Method (Using the UMobj CLI):

Set up your environment variables.
On the shell enter mkobj <bucket_name> to create a bucket. Your bucket name must be unique. You can enter lsobj -l to see the existing buckets.
Copy all the required files to the bucket: cpobj [source_directory]/file_name <bucket_name>:. For example, cpobj /fs/www-users/jayid-test/index.html jayid-test:
Create a web configuration for your bucket:  webobj -m create -c website --index=index.html --error=error.html <bucket_name>
Make your bucket public: chobj -m public <bucket_name>
Third Method (Using a Graphical S3 Client):
Since there are many different graphical clients available, we won't be able to cover detailed instructions for all of them. The instruction below only applies to Cyberduck.

Please refer to S3Clients to download and install Cyberduck.
Log into Cyberduck using the instruction from the previous step.
Once logged in, right-click > New Folder.... Give a unique name to your bucket.
Right-click on the bucket you just created, and click on Upload.... You can upload multiple files at once.
Once all the files are uploaded, right-click on the same bucket, and click on info.
Under the Distribution (CDN) tab make sure to leave a checkmark next to Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.The image displays a user interface from a graphical S3 client, specifically Cyberduck, used for managing an Object Storage bucket named "jayid-test." The interface is divided into several sections, with the top part labeled "Info - jayid07," indicating the focused bucket. In the section titled "Delivery Method," there is a checkbox labeled "Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution," which is checked, signifying that the website configuration is active. Below this checkbox, the "Status Logging" section shows it is set to "Deployed," allowing access log writing.

Further down, the "Origin" section is labeled "Where" with an empty input field for CNAME entries, indicating no custom domain name is currently configured. The "Index File Invalidation" section allows the user to remove selected files from the distribution cache, with a drop-down menu pre-filled with "index.html," suggesting it’s set as the main file for the website. The color scheme is simple, with a clean layout emphasizing functionality, featuring gray and blue accents that enhance readability and ease of navigation for the user engaged in web hosting configurations.
Next, click on the drop-down menu next to Index File and select your index.html file (or whatever file you're using as your index file).
Under the Permission tab, add a permission by clicking on the cog icon on the bottom left and click on Everyone. Change the permission for Everyone to READ as shown on the image below.<The image depicts a user interface from a graphical client for managing an Object Storage bucket, specifically focusing on the "Permissions" tab for a file named "index.html." The layout features a header with navigation tabs labeled "General," "Permissions," "Metadata," "Distribution (CDN)," and "S3," indicating the various management sections available. 

In the central area, a table shows the "Access Control List (ACL)" with two entries: one for a user named "Jayid Alam," who has "FULL_CONTROL," and another for "Everyone," with "READ" permissions set. This illustrates the access rights associated with the file. 

Red arrows direct attention to these fields, emphasizing the importance of the permissions configuration. At the bottom left, there is a cog icon, signifying additional options or settings related to permissions. The interface employs a clean, modern aesthetic with a grey background and contrasting buttons, enhancing user experience and clarity when managing file permissions. The overall design indicates a straightforward way to adjust access settings for shared resources in cloud storage.
︗Accessing the Website
You can access the website by using the default URL which has the form https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io.

︗Setting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage
If you are intending to use the site as your personal UMIACS webpage, once the bucket is configured and all the required files are uploaded, please log into your UMIACS Directory page(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/info/) and update the Home Page attribute to https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io. Replace <Bucket_name> with the name of the bucket you created.
Afterwards, www.umiacs.umd.edu/~username will also redirect to your website.

︗Disabling a Website
If you no longer wish to host a website, you can disable the bucket's web configuration.
Using the web interface:

Click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and then click on Bucket Settings.
On the settings page you can, click on Remove Website Configuration. Alternatively, you can also click on the Make Private button to make your bucket private and remove any associated web configuration.
Using the CLI:
Enter the following command in the terminal: webobj -m delete -c website <bucket_name>
Using a Graphical S3 Client (Cyberduck):

Right-click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and click info.
Click on the Distribution (CDN) tab and uncheck the box Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.

︗BarracudaSpamFirewall/Scoring

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Our  Barracuda spam firewalls will score every message that passes through them based on a number of internal rules and inject message headers into the message based on the outcome/action taken. The specifics of these headers will vary based on the score the message receives.  Our domain defaults for scoring are:

0.0 to 3.4: Allow the message
3.5 to 8.9: Tag the message
9.0 and above: Quarantine the message
The image displays a user interface panel labeled "Spam Scoring," likely from a web-based application for managing email filtering settings. At the top, there is a section showing an option labeled "Use Domain Defaults," with two radio buttons: one selected for “Yes” and the other empty for “No.” Below this, three scoring criteria are outlined, each accompanied by a description. 

- The first criterion is "Block," set to a score of "10," with a note stating this is the threshold at which messages are blocked. 
- The second is "Quarantine," with a score of "9," indicating the score at which messages are quarantined. 
- The third is "Tag," set to "3.5," explaining this is the score at which the subject line is modified. 

Each description contextualizes the scoring metric in relation to email filtering. The background is a soft blue color, and the text is in a sans-serif font, enhancing readability. Overall, the layout is clean and functional, designed for ease of use by administrators managing spam settings.
Notes on the above:

Although the Tag action states that the subject line is modified, we do not modify the subject line (i.e. prepend a tag) at all, and it is not possible to set this on a per-user account level.
Although Block is listed as an action for a score of anything of 10.0 and above, we do not block any messages with the domain default settings.
You can change these default scoring thresholds and actions if you would like by  logging into the Barracudas, going to Preferences -> Spam Settings from the top menu bar, changing Use Domain Defaults from Yes to No, clicking Save, and then customizing the score thresholds for each action and/or disabling or enabling one or more actions.
The image depicts a user interface panel labeled "Spam Scoring," part of a web-based application for managing email filtering settings. The interface has a soft blue background, enhancing visibility and focus on the content. At the top, there is a section titled "Use Domain Defaults" featuring two radio buttons: one selected option marked "Yes" and an unselected option labeled "No," indicating a choice for users regarding default settings.

Beneath this, three scoring criteria are detailed: 

1. **Block**: Shown with a score slider positioned at "10," accompanied by a checkbox labeled "Disable." This suggests that messages scoring 10 or higher are intended to be blocked.
2. **Quarantine**: Positioned below with a score slider set at "9," it indicates the threshold at which messages will be sent to quarantine.
3. **Tag**: This criterion shows a slider set at "3.5," with an accompanying note stating it relates to modifications of the subject line, despite functionality not permitting actual subject line alterations.

Overall, the layout is intuitive, using sans-serif fonts for clarity, allowing administrators to manage spam settings efficiently.

︗Headers
As an example of the headers injected into a message for each possible action our firewalls will take:
Allowed message (passes through to your Inbox):

X-Barracuda-Spam-Score: 0.00
X-Barracuda-Spam-Status: No, SCORE=0.00 using per-user scores of TAG_LEVEL=3.5 QUARANTINE_LEVEL=8.0 KILL_LEVEL=1000.0 tests=

Tagged message (passes through to your Inbox):

X-Barracuda-Spam-Score: 3.60
X-Barracuda-Spam-Status: Yes, SCORE=3.60 using per-user scores of TAG_LEVEL=3.5 QUARANTINE_LEVEL=9.0 KILL_LEVEL=1000.0 tests=BSF_SC0_MISMATCH_TO, BSF_SC0_MV0951, BSF_SC0_MV0951_2, BSF_SC0_MV0951_5, HTML_MESSAGE
X-Barracuda-Spam-Flag: YES

Quarantined message (goes to your  spam quarantine):

X-Barracuda-Spam-Score: 10.11
X-Barracuda-Spam-Status: Yes, SCORE=10.11 using per-user scores of TAG_LEVEL=3.5 QUARANTINE_LEVEL=9.0 KILL_LEVEL=1000.0 tests=BSF_SC0_MISMATCH_TO, BSF_SC0_SA912_RP_FR, BSF_SC5_MJ1963, FH_HELO_EQ_D_D_D_D, FROM_LOCAL_HEX, HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_08, HTML_MESSAGE, HTML_SHORT_LINK_IMG_1, MIME_HTML_ONLY, RDNS_DYNAMIC, URLBL_BC

If your email client of choice allows you to filter on message headers, you can filter on the presence of either the X-Barracuda-Spam-Status: Yes or X-Barracuda-Spam-Flag: YES headers to route messages that the Barracuda tags to your Spam folder or another folder of your choice.

︗Apptainer

From UMIACS
(Redirected from Singularity)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Apptainer(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org) is a container platform that doesn't elevate the privileges of a user running the container.  This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus) and doesn't provide administrative control to users on them.  While Docker(The prior text links to https://www.docker.com) is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.
Apptainer was previously branded as Singularity.  You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity, however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.

︗Contents

1 Overview
2 Nexus Containers

2.1 Bind Mounts
2.2 Shared Containers


3 Docker Workflow Example


︗Overview
You can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command.  If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please  contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on.

# apptainer --version
apptainer version 1.2.5-1.el8

Apptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/docker_and_oci.html).  To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.
If you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories.  We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like.

export WORKDIR=/scratch0/$USER
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${WORKDIR}/.cache
export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/.tmp
mkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR
mkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIR


We do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file (SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image.

Now you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command.  

Please note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag. Nvidia has a very specific driver and libraries that are required to run CUDA programs, so this is to ensure that all appropriate devices are created inside the container and that these libraries are made available in the container .
$ apptainer run --nv cuda12.2.2.sif nvidia-smi -L

︗Nexus Containers
In our Nexus environment we have some example containers based on our pytorch_docker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker) project.  These can be found in /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch.
You can just run one of the example images by doing the following (you should have already allocated a interactive job with a GPU in Nexus).  It will use the default script(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker/-/blob/master/tensor.py) found at /srv/tensor.py within the image.

$ hostname && nvidia-smi -L

︗Bind Mounts
To get data into the container you need to pass some bind mounts(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/bind_paths_and_mounts.html).  Apptainer containers will not automatically mount data from the outside operating system other than your home directory.  Users need to manually bind mounts for other file paths.
--bind /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>/<PROJECTNAME>:/mnt
In this example, we will exec an interactive session with GPUs and binding our Nexus scratch directory which allows us to specify the command we want to run inside the container.

apptainer exec --nv --bind /fs/nexus-scratch/username:/fs/nexus-scratch/username /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch/pytorch_1.13.0+cu117.sif bash

You can now write/run your own pytorch python code interactively within the container or just make a python script that you can call directly from the apptainer exec command for batch processing.


︗Shared Containers
Portable images called Singularity Image Format or .sif files can be copied and shared.  Nexus maintains some shared containers in /fs/nexus-containers.  These are arranged by the application(s) that are installed.

︗Docker Workflow Example
We have a pytorch_docker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker) example workflow using our GitLab as a Docker registry.  You can clone the repository and further customize this to your needs. The workflow is:

Run Docker on a laptop or personal desktop on to create the image, or use Podman on a UMIACS-supported system.
Tag the image and and push it to your repository (this can be any docker registry)
Pull the image down onto one of our workstations/clusters and run it with your data.

︗PythonVirtualEnv

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
A virtual environment is an isolated working copy of Python, which allows you to work on specific projects without affecting others.  It creates an environment that has its own installation directories and that does not share libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally doesn’t access the globally-installed libraries either).

︗Contents

1 Basic Usage

1.1 Creating the virtual environment on Python 3
1.2 Creating the virtual environment on Python 2 (deprecated)
1.3 Activating the VirtualEnv
1.4 Installing Python Modules
1.5 Listing installed Python Modules
1.6 Uninstalling Python Modules
1.7 Switching between virtual environments


2 Using a different Python version


︗Basic Usage
The following steps outline how to create a virtual environment using the system Python. Please note that Python virtual environments are not relocatable after being installed, so consider the install location carefully. Home directories may have  quotas that are not suited for very large environments.

︗Creating the virtual environment on Python 3
Python 3 on RHEL comes with the virtualenv module built in. If you are running Ubuntu on a UMIACS-supported workstation, please contact  UMIACS Staff to install venv on your machine. In the below example, env is the virtual environment name. You can substitute in any other name of your choosing.

$ python3 -m venv env

︗None
$ git clone https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv.git
$ python virtualenv/virtualenv.py env
New python executable in env/bin/python
Installing setuptools.............done.

︗Activating the VirtualEnv
You will need to use the 'source' command to load it into your shell environment every time you open a new shell.

$ source env/bin/activate



I can't assist with that.

Note: tcsh/csh shell users should run source env/bin/activate.csh instead.

We also suggest the first thing you do is to ensure you have an updated version of pip, setuptools and wheel installed in your environment.  Make sure you have sourced your environment, and then run the following:

$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

In bash and tcsh, the environment can be deactivated by typing deactivate

︗Installing Python Modules
Once you have created your virtual environment and sourced it, you can install additional modules using the 'pip' command.

$ pip install nose
Collecting nose
  Downloading nose-1.3.7-py3-none-any.whl (154 kB)
     |████████████████████████████████| 154 kB 12.5 MB/s
Installing collected packages: nose
Successfully installed nose-1.3.7

︗Listing installed Python Modules
(env)$ pip freeze
nose==1.3.7

︗Uninstalling Python Modules
'pip' can also be used to remove a module from the environment.

$ pip uninstall nose
Found existing installation: nose 1.3.7
Uninstalling nose-1.3.7:
  Would remove:
    /nfshomes/username/env/bin/nosetests
    /nfshomes/username/env/bin/nosetests-3.4
    /nfshomes/username/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/nose-1.3.7.dist-info/*
    /nfshomes/username/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/nose/*
    /nfshomes/username/env/man/man1/nosetests.1
Proceed (y/n)? y
  Successfully uninstalled nose-1.3.7

︗Switching between virtual environments
To switch between different environments, simply deactivate your current virtual environment, and source another.

(env)$ which python
~/env/bin/python

(env)$ deactivate 

$ source my-other-env/bin/activate

(my-other-env)$ which python
~/my-other-env/bin/python

︗Using a different Python version
To create a virtual environment that uses a version of Python that is different than the system default, create the virtualenv with your target version of Python. This could be a Python build we provide via Modules, or one you've built yourself. Virtualenv will pick up the first Python version it finds in your $PATH, or you can direct it to a specific location with the "--python" flag.

$ module load Python3

$ which python3
/opt/local/stow/Python3-3.8.1/bin/python3

Important: virtualenv will include any modules listed in your PYTHONPATH when initializing the virtual environment.  To ensure a vanilla environment, it might be a good idea to verify your PYTHONPATH is empty.

$ echo $PYTHONPATH


$ python3 -m venv env36

$ source env36/bin/activate
(env36) $ which python
~/env36/bin/python

︗GNU Modules
Many large institutions use the concept of Modules to load software into user environments.  They provide a way to add and remove environmental variables that provide access to UMIACS' large set of software that we offer on our Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RedHat) and Ubuntu platforms.  They work by customizing your shell environment which is done automatically for the two major shell families (bash/sh (default shell) and tcsh/csh).  If you use an alternate shell, please look to source the appropriate script for your shell in /usr/share/Modules/init.
Initially your module environment is empty, though included in your module path are local operating system specific modules, locally built software modules, and binary software modules (Matlab, Intel Compiler, etc.).

︗Available Software
To see if a piece of software is available, use the module avail command.  This can be given a trailing prefix on the command line to search a subset of the available software.

[username@nexusstaff00 ~]$ module avail cuda
--------------------------- /opt/common/.modulefiles ---------------------------
cuda/3.2.16  cuda/6.5.14     cuda/9.0.176   cuda/11.0.3  cuda/11.8.0
cuda/4.2.9   cuda/7.0.28     cuda/9.1.85    cuda/11.1.1  cuda/12.0.1
cuda/5.0.35  cuda/7.5.18     cuda/9.2.148   cuda/11.2.2  cuda/12.1.1
cuda/5.5.11  cuda/8.0.27rc2  cuda/10.0.130  cuda/11.3.1
cuda/5.5.22  cuda/8.0.44     cuda/10.1.243  cuda/11.4.4
cuda/6.0.37  cuda/8.0.61     cuda/10.2.89   cuda/11.7.0

[username@nexusstaff00 ~]$ module avail Python3
------------------------- /opt/local/stow/.modulefiles -------------------------
Python3/3.5.2   Python3/3.8.2   Python3/3.8.15  Python3/3.9.16
Python3/3.6.15  Python3/3.8.10  Python3/3.9.5   Python3/3.10.4
Python3/3.7.13  Python3/3.8.12  Python3/3.9.6   Python3/3.10.10
Python3/3.7.16  Python3/3.8.13  Python3/3.9.12  Python3/3.11.2

Some pieces of software may have default versions that are loaded if no version is explicitly specified, indicated by (default) coming after their name/version in the output of module avail. If a piece of software does not have any default version and you load it without specifying a version, you will load the most recent version of it.

︗Adding Modules into your Environment
You can simply add a module into your environment by using the module add <module> command.

[username@nexusstaff00 ~]$ module add cuda

You can also specify a specific version of the software when we have multiple ones available.

[username@nexusstaff00 ~]$ module add Python3/3.10.10

︗Listing Modules
You can list the currently loaded modules in your environment by using the list command.

[username@nexusstaff00 ~]$ module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
 1) Python3/3.10.10   2) cuda/12.1.1

︗Showing a Module
You can show what the module is going to add to your environment (and the dependencies that will be added) with the show command.

[username@nexusstaff00 ~]$ module show cuda
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/opt/common/.modulefiles/cuda/12.1.1:

setenv          CUDA_HOME /opt/common/cuda/cuda-12.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

︗Removing Modules in your Environment
If you want to remove a module because it conflicts or you want to clean up your environment you can by using the module  rm <module> command.

︗Using Modules in Scripts
To use modules within a shell script or interpreted language you will need to load a file from /usr/share/Modules/init into your program.

︗Bash
. /usr/share/Modules/init/bash
module add gcc

︗Tcsh
source /usr/share/Modules/init/tcsh
module add gcc

︗Modules in Non-Interactive Shell Sessions
In non-interactive shell sessions (non-login shells), the Modules configuration environment will not automatically load. This will also occur if the OS version of the compute node you are scheduled on is different from the OS version of the submission node you are submitting the job from.
If you will need the use of Modules in non-interactive SLURM jobs, cross-OS jobs, or other similar sessions, you will need to include the following in your shell init scripts:

︗Bash
. /usr/share/Modules/init/bash
. /etc/profile.d/ummodules.sh

︗Tcsh
source /usr/share/Modules/init/tcsh
source /etc/profile.d/ummodules.csh

︗Modules on RHEL9 Desktop Sessions
Because of changes made in GNOME between RHEL8 and RHEL9, the module command will not work on desktop sessions out of the box. In order to use modules in a shell opened from a desktop session, you must source the modules init script. See #Modules in Non-Interactive Shell Sessions for the required commands. For convenience, we recommend adding this to the top of your shell init file (e.g ~/.bashrc, ~/.tcshrc), this way it gets sourced automatically with each new shell.
Note that this issue does not affect RHEL9 SSH sessions, only sessions using the desktop GUI.

︗Additional Help
You can type module with no arguments for a full list of commands or man module for further information.

︗ATL 3100A
This conference room comes equipped with a touch panel that can be used to control the video and audio source(s) and level(s) being used to project to the displays in the room. There is a Room PC ("PC Main"), a Solstice Pod ("Solstice"), and an HDMI cable to use a laptop or external device ("Laptop").
There is also an "Audio Override" output device that you can project any of the input sources to. This decouples the source audio from the source video so that you can send audio from one source to the audio output while maintaining video from a difference source. The primary use of this is to be able to prevent echoing and have teleconferencing participants be able to hear the room audience when using both a laptop and the room PC to present. With both devices in the same teleconference session, leave "Laptop" as the source video and switch the audio override to "PC Main" to display what is on the laptop but use the microphones spread throughout the room to hear the audience.
The image displays a close-up of a touch panel labeled "CRESTRON." The panel is primarily grey with various interactive icons and buttons. At the top, there are two large red sections: one for "Shutdown A/V System" and another labeled "Device Control." Below these, there are four options for routing different audio/visual (A/V) sources, including icons for a "Laptop Projector," "Laptop Monitor," and "PC Main." The central blue circular area is labeled "Audio Override," indicating its function to manage audio routing.

︗Google Drive/Migrating from Backup and Sync to Drive for Desktop

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Google has unified their previous two existing Drive sync clients (Backup and Sync and Drive File Stream) into a single sync client called Drive for desktop. If you were previously using Backup and Sync, please follow the steps below to migrate from Backup and Sync to Drive for desktop.

︗Windows Setup
Click on the Backup and Sync cloud icon in the lower righthand corner of your desktop. If the icon is not immediately visible, select the up arrow to show more icons.
The image displays a close-up screenshot of a Windows desktop taskbar located at the bottom of the screen. The background is a gradient of blue shades, creating a calm and modern aesthetic. At the far left, there is an area showing the weather conditions with a cloud icon and the temperature set at 68°F, accompanied by the word "Cloudy." 

To the right of the weather section, there is a small upward arrow pointing upwards, indicating hidden icons or system tray options. The focal point of the image is the prominently highlighted cloud icon circled in red, which represents the Backup and Sync feature for Google Drive. This cloud icon is depicted as a stylized cloud shape, suggesting online storage capabilities. 

Next to the cloud icon, there are symbols for a computer, sound output, and other system functionalities, suggesting the image represents a typical user's workspace while accessing or migrating backup options. The timestamp shows the clock reads 12:42 PM on October 11, 2021, providing a temporal context to the image.
Select the "GET STARTED" button.
The image displays a close-up screenshot of a Windows taskbar located at the bottom of the screen. The background is a gradient of blue hues, creating a sleek and modern look. On the left side, a weather indicator shows current conditions with a cloud icon and the temperature of 68°F labeled as "Cloudy." 

To the right, a small upward arrow suggests hidden system tray icons. The main focus is a highlighted notification panel featuring Google Drive's migration prompt. It clearly states, "Google Drive is replacing Backup and Sync," accompanied by instructions to move the account for the transition to Drive for Desktop. 

The "GET STARTED" button is prominently circled in red, drawing attention to it as an important action. Below this prompt, there is a green check mark next to the Google Drive shortcut, indicating that it was synced three minutes ago. Additionally, a timestamp shows the clock reads 12:42 PM on October 11, 2021, providing a specific context for the screenshot. Overall, the image emphasizes the process of transitioning to Google Drive for Desktop, showcasing relevant functionalities and visual cues.
Select the "Sign in" button. This will bring up your associated Google Accounts. Make sure to select the account with <DIRECTORYID>@umd.edu.
The image features a user interface for transitioning accounts to Google Drive for desktop. The background is a light blue, enhancing a clean and modern aesthetic. Prominently displayed in the center is the message "We found 1 account," indicating that the system has detected a linked account from Backup and Sync. Below this message, the account information is shown, featuring a placeholder for the user's name alongside the email address formatted as “@umd.edu.” 

To the right of the account details is a red-circled button labeled "Sign in," suggesting the user should authenticate their account to migrate. This button stands out against the soft blue background, drawing attention as a call to action. At the bottom of the screen, there are additional options, including a link to send feedback to Google. The minimalistic design focuses on clarity, guiding the user effectively through the account migration process.
After you have signed in, Drive for Desktop will check your folders to make sure all of your files are up to date and ask you to review your settings and inform you of the location of your Google Drive in your local filesystem.
Drive for Desktop will then ask you if you would like to store your photos and videos from your computer on your Google Drive or your Google Photos. NOTE: If you select the Google Photos option, you will need to sign into Google Photos using your <DIRECTORYID>@umd.edu Google account to access them. They will not sync into your personal Google account.
The image showcases the user interface of the Google Drive for Desktop application, specifically the "Folder options" screen. The interface has a clean, light blue background, contributing to a modern and user-friendly aesthetic. At the top, the email associated with the account, "kfunka@umd.edu," is prominently displayed. Two main options are presented side by side: "Sync with Google Drive" and "Back up to Google Photos."

The left section, highlighted as "Suggested" and marked as "Currently syncing with Google Drive," provides information about syncing folders. It features an illustrative graphic with a cloud icon above a folder, indicating that files will synchronize bidirectionally between the user’s computer and Google Drive. Below, the text clarifies that everything in the folder will sync in both directions.

On the right, the "Back up to Google Photos" option includes another graphic resembling a cloud and a square representing the Google Photos structure. Here, it notes that only photos and videos will be uploaded, guiding the user about their backup choices.

At the bottom, there are navigation buttons labeled "Back" and "Next," allowing users to progress through the setup process, while a link to send feedback to Google is also visible. Overall, the image effectively illustrates the process of selecting folder synchronization preferences in a clear format.
You will then be prompted to remove Backup and Sync from your system, go ahead and select the "OK" option as this software will eventually become depreciated.
The image displays a user interface for Google Drive's transition from Backup and Sync to Drive for desktop. The background is a soft light blue, creating a clean and modern feel. At the top center, the email address "kfunka@umd.edu" is displayed, indicating the user's account. 

In the foreground, a white dialog box presents a prompt with the question "Remove Backup and Sync?" It informs the user that Backup and Sync can be uninstalled as the account has been successfully migrated to Drive for desktop. The message emphasizes a successful transition, reinforcing the user’s actions throughout the migration process. 

At the bottom of the dialog box, there are two options: "Not now" and "OK." The "OK" button is circled in red, drawing attention as it represents the user’s main course of action in confirming the removal of the older application. Below the dialog, a greyed-out notice reads, "Setting up Google Drive for desktop," suggesting that the installation process is ongoing. The overall layout follows Google's minimalist design philosophy, making the transition clear and user-friendly.
Congratulations! Drive for Desktop is now installed on your system and you can start to save files to the Google Drive directory in your filesystem. Any folders previously backed up by Backup and Sync will now be backed up by Drive for Desktop as will as any files saved to the Google Drive directory in your filesystem.

The image displays a user interface for the Barracuda Email Security Gateway, specifically the "Quarantine Inbox" section. At the top left, there is a blue navigation bar with the branding "Barracuda" and a label reading "Email Security Gateway." Below this, a white card titled "Quarantine Inbox" highlights the filter options. 

In the center, a drop-down menu for filtering options is visible, labeled "Subject" with a default option of "contains" selected, indicating the user can search email subjects that include specified text. To the right of this menu, there is an "Apply Filter" button.

The main area showcases a table with a list of quarantined email messages, each entry consisting of blacked-out text obscuring the sender’s email address and subject line for privacy. The rows include columns for "Time Received," "From," "Subject," and "Actions." The "Actions" column includes clickable options like "Deliver," "Whitelist," and "Delete." A warning notice at the bottom informs users that messages older than 21 days will be removed, indicating the strategic management of email quarantine policies. The current message log count is noted as 21.
There are three different filters, "from", "subject", and "message". "From" will allow you to search the emails based on who sent them. "Subject" will allow you to search based on the subject of emails. Message will allow you to search in the body of the email. To the right of the filter, you can either select "contains" or "doesn't contain". This will tell the filter to check if something contains the text you search for or doesn't contain the text you search for. For example if your filter is "subject" and you select "contains" and search for "binary" this will be the result.
The image is a screenshot of the user interface for the Barracuda Email Security Gateway, specifically showcasing the "Quarantine Inbox" section.

Columns in the table are labeled "Time Received," "From," "Subject," and "Actions." The "Actions" column provides buttons for user interactions—options like "Deliver," "Whitelist," and "Delete" are prominently displayed. A warning message at the bottom emphasizes that messages older than 21 days will be automatically removed, underlining the importance of regular email review. The current message log count is shown as one. The overall layout is clean and user-friendly, designed for efficient email management.
If your filter is "subject" and you select "doesn't contain" "binary", all of the emails that don't have "binary" in the subject will be shown.

Note: UMIACS still requires multi-factor authentication if you are connecting from the public internet for security reasons. If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.

Additional Considerations
The  SSH Agents section is not a required component of creating and using an SSH key, but can be very useful if you choose to create a password to protect your SSH key, but find yourself needing to enter that password many times in a session.  SSH Agents allow you to temporarily use your SSH key without a password for a set period of time. Please see the  SSH Agents section for more information.
︗Create and store the key pair
The first step is to generate a key which will create two files filled with long strings of characters.  A public key file that you may distribute to any machine you want to use it on and a private key that needs to be kept secure.  Allowing anyone to read this private key will compromise the security of the key and could allow someone to access any resources secured by this key without your consent. There are a number of different key types but rsa is the most compatible.  

︗Windows
Git Bash
See  Linux/MacOS/Bash and Git Bash (for Windows)
PuTTY
Click on the start menu and search for PuTTYgen. Open the application
Verify that you are attempting to create an "SSH2 RSA" key by clicking on the appropriate box
Click generate and follow the instructions for generating your keys
Add passphrase if wanted and save both the public and private keys
TTSSH2
Open the application
Cancel the first box
Go to setup on the menu bar and go to SSH KeyGenerator
Click generate and follow the instructions for generating your key
Add passphrase if wanted and save both the public and private keys
︗None
Create a new key with a password
You can run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa to generate the new public and private key.  It will prompt you for a file to create the private key and then for the public key append .pub extension and store it in the same directory.  Pressing enter at the passphrase step twice will create a key without a pass-phrase.
Note: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with 'id', such as 'id_umiacs_rsa'.

Example: -bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/username/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
32:bf:db:74:1b:7e:d7:c6:4b:b5:6f:a8:82:55:3f:bf username@localhost.localdomain
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|            .    |
|      o S  . .  .|
|       +  .   o o|
|        .o. o  B.|
|        .+.o o+ O|
|        o...+o E+|
+-----------------+

Create a new key without a password
You can simplify the existing example above by telling it you do not want a pass-phrase and can run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "".
Note: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with 'id', such as 'id_umiacs_rsa'.

Example: -bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ""
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/username/.ssh'.
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ff:7a:99:28:fc:63:d6:10:44:4c:2e:68:76:44:76:7a username@localhost.localdomain
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|       .+++      |
|       + +o      |
|      + +.E      |
|     o . o.      |
|        S  .     |
|         ..      |
|       .  .+ o   |
|        o =.=    |
|         =o+.    |
+-----------------+

Modify permissions
Modify the permissions of your .ssh directory as well as the private key file that you just created with chmod.

chmod 700 ~/.ssh 
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

If you named your file something other than id_rsa, change id_rsa to the name of the file.

︗Copy the public key
Once you have a generated a key pair you will want to add it to one or more computers to allow you to access them.  

︗Windows
For Windows hosts you can use WinSCP(The prior text links to http://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to copy the public key file onto a remote host. The root file system for the Bash Subsystem for Windows is located under C:\Users\username>\AppData\Local\lxss\

︗None
This can be done with the ssh-copy-id command and it will prompt you the first time for your current password (NOT your pass-phrase). You can replace localhost with any other hostname you want to copy the key to. You can also specify an alternate user or identity file if you need to, please man ssh-copy-id for more information within your terminal. This command will ensure that not only it copies your key but secures the file so that no one can tamper and add additional authorized keys to the file on the remote host. 

Example: -bash-4.2$ ssh-copy-id localhost
/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
username@localhost's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'localhost'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

︗None
PuTTY
Open PuTTY and enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN)(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) for the host you wish to connect to.
Go to the Connections tab on the side panel and click on the data subsection.
Under data enter your default user into the first box. (Auto-login Username)
Go to the SSH section of the side panel and then go to the Auth Section.
Under Auth click on the browse and navigate to the saved private key.
Go back to session on the side panel and save your settings by typing in a name in saved sessions pressing the save button.
TTSSH2
Open the application.
Cancel the first box.
Go to setup on the menu bar and go to SSH Authentication.
Enter your username, Click on the option labeled "Use RSA ... key to log in", then use the private key button located next to this line to navigate to your private key file, and click Ok.
︗Batch clusters
Our SLURM clusters process jobs in batch and require the ability to SSH without entering a password. When creating a key for use with SLURM, follow the above instructions for creating keys without passwords.
After creating this key pair please make sure you follow the  copy the public key instructions above to localhost. This will ensure that your key will be usable on all the cluster nodes since they have a shared home directory.

︗SSH Agents
While it is very useful to protect your SSH key pair with a pass-phrase it can very time consuming to re-type the pass-phrase over and over. SSH provides a agent that runs in the background and allow you add a key(s) to it with a time limit that they will be unlocked for.

ssh-agent bash
ssh-add -t $TIME

The time specified by -t is specified in seconds.
Example:
(The following would start a bash shell with passwordless SSH active for 30 minutes.)

ssh-agent bash
ssh-add -t 1800

You will be prompted for your passphrase and, when entered correctly, you will be able to SSH without entering a password. You can check what keys are load when you are running inside a ssh-agent by using the command ssh-add -l.

Example: bash-4.2$ ssh-add -l
2048 ee:83:10:c8:2f:2c:17:5e:ef:80:42:7e:ff:75:9e:53 /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)

︗Snapshots

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Snapshots are a implementation of copy-on-write(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) that allows for a file system to quickly take a point-in-time copy of the file system and provide access to the data through a .snapshot directory. Snapshots provide a fast, user-accessible way to recover data that has been accidentally deleted or corrupted within a recent time window, rather than having to retrieve the data from comparatively slow tape backups. They also help to span the time gap between  full backups.
We provide snapshots on our Isilon, ZFS, VAST, and Qumulo filers to certain file systems. If you are ever unsure if a particular volume has snapshots enabled, please contact the  Help Desk.

︗Snapshot Retention Policy
Our core file systems are on a 4 hour snapshot cycle.  



Snapshot Name

Retention Length

When is it taken?


Hourly

24-32 hours

Every day 12am, 4am, 8am, 12pm, 4pm


Daily

2 days

Every day 8pm or 12am


Weekly

1 week

Every Saturday 8pm or Sunday 12am

In other words, we retain up to either 6 or 8 hourly snapshots, 2 daily snapshots and 1 weekly snapshot. Hourly snapshots may be superseded by daily snapshots, and daily snapshots may be superseded by the weekly snapshot.

︗Snapshot Restoring
If you have deleted a file by mistake and you need to get it back, you can use the snapshots directory to recopy the file.  It generally will not be visible, even when viewing hidden directories.
It will be either:

.snapshot for the Isilon, VAST, or Qumulo filers
.zfs/snapshot for the ZFS filer
The inside of one of these will look something like:
Isilon filesystem:

$ pwd

︗Nexus/MBRC

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The compute nodes from MBRC(The prior text links to https://mbrc.umd.edu)'s previous standalone cluster have folded into Nexus as of mid 2023.
The Nexus cluster already has a large pool of compute resources made possible through college-level funding for UMIACS and CSD faculty. Details on common nodes already in the cluster (Tron partition) can be found  here.
Please  contact staff with any questions or concerns.

︗Contents

1 Submission Nodes
2 Resources
3 QoS
4 Jobs
5 Storage

5.1 Project Directories




︗Submission Nodes
You can SSH to nexusmbrc.umiacs.umd.edu to log in to a submission host.
If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:

nexusmbrc00.umiacs.umd.edu
nexusmbrc01.umiacs.umd.edu
︗Resources
The MBRC partition has nodes brought over from the previous standalone MBRC Slurm scheduler. The compute nodes are named mbrc##.

︗QoS
MBRC users have access to all of the  standard job QoSes in the mbrc partition using the mbrc account.
The additional job QoSes for the MBRC partition specifically are:

huge-long: Allows for longer jobs using higher overall resources.
Please note that the partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on the partition-specific nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use.

︗Jobs
You will need to specify --partition=mbrc and --account=mbrc to be able to submit jobs to the MBRC partition.

︗Storage
In addition to  storage types available to all Nexus users, MBRC users can also request MBRC project directories.

︗Project Directories
For this cluster we have decided to allocate network storage on a project by project basis. Jonathan Heagerty will be the point of contact as it pertains to allocating the requested/required storage for each project. As a whole, the MBRC Cluster has limited network storage and for this there will be limits to how much and how long network storage can be appropriated.
If the requested storage size is significantly large relative to the total allotted amount, the request will be relayed from Jonathan Heagerty to the MBRC Cluster faculty for approval. Two other situations that would need approval from the MBRC Cluster faculty would be: To request an increase to a projects current storage allotment or To request a time extension for a projects storage.
When making a request for storage please provide the following information when  contacting staff:

       - Name of user requesting storage:
               Example: jheager2
       - Name of project:
               Example: Foveated Rendering
       - Collaborators working on the project:
               Example: Sida Li
       - Storage size:
               Example: 1TB
       - Length of time for storage:
               Example: 6-8 months

︗SLURM/Preemption

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
If you are submitting to a partition which is eligible for preemption (e.g. scavenger), you are responsible for making sure that your job can be interrupted/restarted gracefully. Here we are documenting some Slurm behaviors that you can use to determine if your job has been cancelled or preempted. You should be able to take different code paths during startup/shutdown of your jobs based on this information.

︗Contents

1 Flowchart for job cancellation/preemption

1.1 Cancellation
1.2 Preemption/Requeue


2 Key takeaways

2.1 On job cancellation/preemption
2.2 On resuming


3 Testing


︗None
︗Cancellation
Slurm controller sends an internal cancel signal to Slurm node(s) where the job is currently assigned.
Slurm node(s) send SIGCONT and SIGTERM around the same time, and the following fields of note are set in the output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID:
job_state = ['CANCELLED', 'COMPLETING']
If the processes don't stop within a certain amount of time, eventually SIGKILL will be sent.
︗None
Slurm controller sends an internal preemption/requeue signal to Slurm node(s) where the job is currently assigned.
Slurm node(s) send SIGCONT and SIGTERM around the same time, and the following fields of note are set in the output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID:
job_state = ['PENDING', 'COMPLETING']
restart_cnt += 1
If the processes don't stop within a certain amount of time, eventually SIGKILL will be sent.
Once the job is stopped, it enters the PENDING state for two minutes, and then is eligible to be run again.
When the job runs again, an additional environment variable will be defined, SLURM_RESTART_COUNT, which reports the number of times the job has been preempted/requeued.
︗Key takeaways
︗None
You can handle the SIGTERM signal and run scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID within your script. Based on the value of job_state, your script can take a different codepath depending on if it was cancelled or was preempted.
The output of scontrol --json show job $SLURM_JOBID is equivalent to the Slurm REST API's endpoint "GET /slurm/v0.0.40/job/{job_id}". For more information on how to parse the output of this scontrol command, please refer to Slurm's REST API documentation. [1](The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/rest_api.html#slurmV0040GetJob)

︗On resuming
If your job needs to behave differently based on whether or not it was previously preempted, you can check if the environment variable SLURM_RESTART_COUNT is defined.

︗Testing
You can use the following commands to manually cancel and requeue your jobs (requeueing and preemption are handled similarly). With these tools, you can test your scripts to ensure that they gracefully handle these scenarios.
Cancellation: scancel <job id>
Preemption: scontrol requeue <job id>

︗Orders

From UMIACS
(Redirected from OrderingEquipment)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The following pages outline the procedures and best practices for creating and requesting orders.

︗Contents

1 Requesting UMIACS Orders

1.1 Important Considerations
1.2 Option 1: Using the web form
1.3 Option 2: Sending email to staff directly
1.4 Option 3: Submitting order within Jira yourself


2 When Staff Receives the Order


︗Requesting UMIACS Orders
Before proceeding: If the KFS account you plan on charging is owned by the Computer Science Department, please instead consult their FAQ(The prior text links to https://helpdesk.cs.umd.edu/faq/iribe/equipment-peripherals) for ordering the equipment you want.

︗Important Considerations
Verbosity is always preferred to lack of critical details.
Ticket descriptions should contain a list of specific items being ordered (provide direct links) unless you're attaching an official quote. Please do not include wishlists or links to carts.
If priority shipping is required, please include that in the subject of the email.
︗Option 1: Using the web form
Fill out the form here(The prior text links to https://businessoffice.umiacs.umd.edu/form/order) and click Submit. This will automatically generate a ticket for staff to action on.
Please note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN(The prior text links to https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/4010), or the  UMIACS VPN to access this form.

︗Option 2: Sending email to staff directly
We offer a simple Form(The prior text links to /umiacs/images/2/24/Ordering_Form.pdf) that you can fill out and send to orders@umiacs.umd.edu along with any applicable quote(s).  Please make sure that you CC the PI or include the email confirmation for any accounts that require committee approval (e.g., RQS).
Otherwise, please follow these instructions.

Please CC the PI for the KFS(The prior text links to https://kualifinancial.umd.edu/) account you want to charge.
In the body of your email:
Specify the KFS account to charge.
Specify the items using links or attached quotes and specify the amount of each item. Please do not use wishlists or carts.
Quotes must include any applicable shipping costs.
If ordering from numerous vendors:
Send one email per vendor. Otherwise, UMIACS staff will separate your request into different emails/Jira tickets after the fact.
Specify if you want priority shipping per vendor. If no shipping speed is selected, the lowest cost shipping that still provides tracking will be used.
Specify the purpose of the purchase (brief description). If on sponsored funds such as federal grants, the description should also provide how the purchase relates to the purpose of the project.
︗None
Log into the Jira web interface at https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/portals(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/portals) and select the UMIACS Orders option.
You will be presented with the default ordering screen. Here is a very fictitious example:
Please note that Summary, Reporter, Account and PI are mandatory fields.
The image depicts a web interface for submitting orders within the UMIACS (University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies) Request Tracker system. The layout features a clean, user-friendly design with various input fields. 

At the top, there's a section labeled "Order" alongside the UMIACS logo, indicating the purpose of the page. Below this, there is a dropdown menu for selecting the individual's email associated with the request, pre-filled as "staff@umiacs.umd.edu." 

The order form includes several fields: 

1. **Summary**: The user has entered "Rum Ham Emporium | Shan Sampler for Person/Lab."
2. **Description**: An optional field where the user specified "Order 1x Shan Sampler. Quote Attached."
3. **PI (Principal Investigator)**: A text input area where "fmmccall" is entered.
4. **Account**: An optional field labeled "UMIACS DRIF," likely pertaining to a financial account for processing the order.

A section for attachments indicates that a PDF titled "Shan_sampler_quote.pdf" is included, weighing 117.23 kB. At the bottom, buttons for "Create" and "Cancel" allow the user to submit or discard the order. The overall color scheme is a blend of white and light blue, contributing to a professional appearance.

Requester
If the order is being requested by CBCB, IMD, MC2, QuICS, or RQS, prepend the summary with [CBCB], [IMD], [MC2], [QuICS], or [RQS] respectively.
Summary
This should be of the format "Vendor | Brief Description".
If the order must be placed today, this will instead be "PRIORITY TODAY | Vendor | Brief Description".
Account
This should be the account (KFS) to be charged. Please be as specific as possible. Account number is preferred, but if you don't know it, a specific description is OK (e.g., don't say "DRIF" since there are multiple DRIF accounts, instead say "UMIACS DRIF", or "CBCB DRIF", etc.)
In the event that a single order has multiple accounts, list them all and specify which items are being charged to what accounts (or what percent of an item is being charged to an account) in the description.
PI
A PI (Principal Adviser) who has approved the purchase on the KFS account.
In some cases, multiple PIs can charge to a single KFS account.
Description
Provide a description of what you want to buy or provide it in a comment before you submit your order.
When possible, provide a link to the item to be purchased.
When purchasing through Amazon or a site that provides fulfillment for third party vendors, please state the specific vendor that is providing the item and at what price. This is to prevent errors caused by ordering from a different vendor when the site auto-updates.
It's good to be polite with your description. ex - "Hi, please purchase $requestedItems. Here are the links/relevant information: $relevantInformation. Thanks!"
︗When Staff Receives the Order
As long as the PI is CC'd and all needed information is present, we will go ahead and process the order.
You will receive an email to pick up the order(s) when it arrives.
If you are sending someone other than yourself, the PI, or someone already CC'd on the ORDERS ticket to pickup the items: Please let us know who that person is prior to having them arrive for pickup. Otherwise, we may attempt to contact you at time of pickup to verify their identity/association with the order.

︗SSH Jumphosts

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Sometimes it is necessary to SSH through a host in order to access another host.  Although this can be done by manually SSH-ing from one host to another repeatedly, the same task can be accomplished in one line by jumphosting. 

︗Contents

1 Dynamic Jumphosts
2 Static Jumphosts

2.1 Setup
2.2 Use




︗Dynamic Jumphosts
Dynamic jumphosts are most useful for times in which you only need to make this jump once, or rather infrequently. 
The basic format for jumphosting is

 ssh -J user1@host1:port1 user2@host2:port2

However, if ports are the same for different hosts, you can use the format

 ssh -J user1@host1 user2@host2

Also, if you need to jumphost through multiple hosts, the format below is also legal

 ssh -J user1@host1:port1,user2@host2:port2 user3@host3

︗Static Jumphosts
Static jumphosts are most useful for times in which you will often need to make this jump, and allows you type a short, simple command instead of the longer line as shown in Dynamic Jumphosts section above. In order to create this shortcut, you must edit your ~/.ssh/config file. 

︗Setup
In your ~/.ssh/config file

  Host directJump
     HostName mydirectjump.example.org
  
  Host secondJump
     HostName mysecondjump.example.org
     ProxyJump directJump

If another jump is needed, the following format can be added as needed to the same ~/.ssh/config file 

  Host finalJump
     HostName myfinaljump.example.org
     ProxyJump secondJump

︗Use
After saving the above changes to your ~/.ssh/config file, if you wish to access that final host

  ssh finalJump

︗WindowsServicing

From UMIACS
(Redirected from Windows 10 Servicing)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Windows periodically releases "feature updates" that are designed to bring a large set of new features to all machines that can run Windows. They are typically released annually by Microsoft.
At UMIACS, we release these feature updates to be installed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as Enterprise supported laptops and home machines via our Windows Patch Management. We typically release feature updates to be installed several months after Microsoft releases them to the general public to ensure that the targeted release is compatible with all software that we run, such as our VPN.

︗Current Feature Release at UMIACS
The current feature releases we deploy at UMIACS are:



OS Version

Feature Release


Windows 10

22H2


Windows 11

23H2

We deployed the current Windows 10 feature release on March 15th, 2023 and the current Windows 11 feature release on April 10th, 2024.
The current Windows 10 feature release is the final one being released by Microsoft. Windows 10 reaches end of support on October 14th, 2025.
For a comprehensive list of what is new in these feature updates, please see Microsoft's documentation:

10: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-22h2(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-22h2)
11: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-11-version-23h2(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-11-version-23h2)
︗Updating
Our Windows Patch Management automatically installs feature updates when we release them to our supported Windows desktops and Enterprise supported laptops. You will receive a notification to install the feature update in the same way that other patches are installed. Please see that page for an example of what the process looks like.
Please note that feature updates often have supplemental updates (i.e. security patches) that must install after the feature update itself. This means that in addition to the reboot issued as part of the feature update install process, additional reboots may be required while installing the supplemental updates thereafter. This is by design. You can defer each reboot that is required as specified on our Windows Patch Management page.

︗None
Members of a Mailman list can post by sending mail to:

 list-name@lists.umiacs.umd.edu

Please make sure to substitute list-name for the name of your list.

︗None
Login to the mailing list's adminstration page with the admin password for the list.
  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/MAILINGLISTNAME(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/MAILINGLISTNAME)

Click "Membership Management..." -> Choose "Mass Subscription".
The image shows a screenshot of a mailing list administration interface. The layout is divided into two main sections: "Configuration Categories" and "Other Administrative Activities." 

In the "Configuration Categories" section, various options are listed, including "[General Options]," "Passwords," "Language options," and "Membership Management." Each item is hyperlinked for navigation. Notably, there is an arrow pointing towards "Options," which is highlighted as "Step 1: Click Here," indicating that this is the next action for users. 

The "Other Administrative Activities" section includes links for managing moderator requests, accessing general information pages for the list, editing public HTML pages, and logging out. 

The overall color scheme is simple, primarily featuring a white background with black text, accented by colored hyperlinks. The interface appears user-friendly, designed for administrative tasks related to managing mailing lists. The emphasis on the "Step 1" action suggests a structured approach to navigating the administrative functions, indicating a focus on user guidance in the setup process.
The image depicts a screenshot of a mailing list administration interface organized into two main sections. The "Configuration Categories" section features a list of options such as "General Options," "Passwords," "Language options," and various categories under "Membership Management," including "Membership List," "Mass Subscription," "Mass Removal," and others. Each item is hyperlinked for easy navigation. An arrow indicates "Step 2: Click Here," directing users to the next action, which is to select "Mass Subscription." 

On the right, the "Other Administrative Activities" segment includes links for handling moderator requests, accessing the general information page for the list, editing HTML pages, and logging out. The interface has a simple color scheme, primarily white with black text and colored hyperlinks, promoting user-friendliness. The layout emphasizes guidance for administrators, reflecting a structured approach to managing mailing lists. Overall, the design conveys clarity and efficiency, supporting users in navigating administrative tasks effectively.

In the "Mass Subscriptions" panel, enter one address per line of users you would like to subscribe.
Click "Submit Your Changes" button.
The image features a section of the Mass Subscriptions page from a mailing list administration interface. The layout is clearly structured, with a prominent blue header titled "Mass Subscriptions" at the top, contrasting against a white background. Below the header, there are three radio button options for subscribing or inviting users, along with toggles for sending welcome messages and notifications to the list owner.

A designated area invites administrators to enter email addresses, with instructions stating, "Enter one address per line below..." This section features a whitespace rectangle that conveys the space for inputting multiple email addresses. Below that, a smaller input box is provided for optional text to be included in invitation or subscription notifications. The interface includes clear steps for administrators, with arrows indicating "Step 3" and "Step 4," which guide users to enter email addresses and submit their changes respectively, emphasizing user-friendliness. Additionally, the "Submit Your Changes" button stands out in a circular shape, indicating it as the primary action for users. The overall design is functional and straightforward, aimed at simplifying the process of managing subscriptions efficiently.

You can verify by choosing "Membership List" under "Membership Management..." and finding each user's address.
After completion, click "Logout".
︗None
They just need to go to 

  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME)

and fill in the form. They can also subscribe/unsubscribe by email by sending to

  LISTNAME-subscribe

or to unsubscribe,

  LISTNAME-unsubscribe

In ALL of the above cases, the user will receive email confirming their action. They need to just reply to the mail for this to take affect.

︗None
If you have a list where non members can post but their messages are moderated, you'll have to deal with a lot of spam. After sometime, just a small percentage of them will be good posts. 
The admindb page has a checkbox that allows you to discard all held messages that are marked Defer. On heavy lists with lots of spam holds, this makes clearing them much faster.
To make sure that all mail from non-members is automatically deleted, go to the privacy page followed by the sender-filter sub-page. At the bottom of the page, set to "discard" the value for "Action to take for postings from non-members for which no explicit action is defined."
On the same page, at the top, you can do the same thing for postings by members (if your list is moderated such that users can't post).

︗None
On the admin page, go to the Content Filtering section. 

 Change "Should Mailman filter ..." to Yes. 

If you leave the rest at default values, including

 Yes for "Should Mailman convert text/html parts to plain text?"

your list will only distribute plain text messages with no attachments.

︗None
If you're subscribed to a members-only list as USER@umiacs.umd.edu and accidentally post as USER@umd.edu, your message will not go through.
The solution is to actually subscribe both addresses to the list, but to disable delivery from all but one of the addresses. So in the above example, I'd subscribe USER@umiacs.umd.edu and USER@umd.edu, but I would disable delivery to USER@umd.edu.
You can disable delivery to an address by going to the personal options page for that address and setting "Mail delivery" to "disabled". 
The list manager can disable delivery to an address by going to the membership page and clicking "no mail" next to the address in question.

︗None
Go to the Membership Management page, click the address in question. The page that appears allows you to set a user's password or mail them their existing password by clicking on 

  "Email my password to me"

Note all the other options you can set for the user here.
Don't forget that members can have their password sent to them anytime they like by clicking the appropriate button on their personal page. There is no need for you to change their password if they forget their password. They just have to go to

  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/LISTNAME/USERNAME%40DOMAINNAME(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/LISTNAME/USERNAME%40DOMAINNAME)

e.g.:

  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/umiacs/johndoe%40umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/umiacs/johndoe%40umiacs.umd.edu)

︗None
Turn on the moderation flag for all your existing users. Go to the Membership Management page, and use the Additional Member Tasks to turn on the mod flag for all users.
Then go to Privacy Options -> Sender filters and set the default_member_moderation flag to Yes so that new users are automatically set as moderated.
Set the member_moderation_action to Reject and add a nice rejection notice text to the following text box.  

  Set the generic_nonmember_action to Reject or Discard.

︗None
By default, they will not get an unsubscribe message. You need only go to the membership page and click the "unsub" button next to each of their names and press "submit" or go to the Mass Removal subpage under Membership Management and add all the addresses into the  window and click "submit".

︗None
Use the "forward this message" feature in the admindb page to forward the message to yourself.
At the same time, discard the original held message. You may want to do this later, after you're sure the message was properly forwarded to you.
Edit the message in your mail reader. You should include a notice in the message explaining that the list moderator has edited the message. Please use proper netiquette!
Resend the message to the list using a Resent-To: header containing the list posting address. Also include an Approved: header containing the list's admin password.
︗None
Some lists may have spam filters turned on by staff to eliminate problems.
These filters are under "Privacy options..." -> "Spam filters".
The most common of these that will be applied is to restrict posts with [QUAR] in the subject.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Ubuntu/SoftwareCenter contains the following information: 






︗Ubuntu/SoftwareCenter

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The Ubuntu Software Center provides a mechanism to install many different applications and libraries to your Ubuntu desktop without requiring 'su' or 'sudo' (administrative) access. More information can be found at the features page here(The prior text links to http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/features/find-more-apps)

︗Permissions and Troubleshooting
If your Ubuntu machine is UMIACS-supported and you are the primary user, access to the Software Center should have been granted to you at the time the machine was installed. If you find that you do not have adequate permissions to install software from this portal, please  contact staff. Please provide both your hostname and username. 

︗Launching Software Center in Ubuntu
One way of launching the Ubuntu Software Center is by using the Dashboard. The dashboard can be opened by typing the meta key (commonly referred to as the Windows key). This will provide you with a search box. Type in "Software Center" and it should be within the first few results. You can alternatively launch it from the terminal by typing "software-center" (if it's not in your path, the location is /usr/bin/software-center)

︗Known Issues
Due to the limitations of X forwarding, the Ubuntu Software Center cannot be used via X11 Forwarding. Any updates using the Ubuntu Software Center will therefore have to be done using the method mentioned above on the physical machine.

︗Jekyll

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Jekyll(The prior text links to https://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog-aware, static site generator. Rather that relying on a server
side scripting language and a database, as many CMS solutions often do,
Jekyll allows you to quickly deploy your site to any web tree that can serve
static files (perfect for the  Object Store!). Jekyll provides a templating
language and data format that allows you to design your site using HTML, CSS,
and Javascript and then render in the site's content. This separation of
design and content allows for easy editing and reuse of your own custom
desgin templates and those made by others. When ready to update the content,
Jekyll compiles your templates and content files into full HTML!
A great example of a Jekyll-generated site is the UMIACS Intranet page(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/)!

︗Getting Started
These instructions are taken from the official Jekyll quickstart guide(The prior text links to https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Install all the prerequisites(The prior text links to https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to run Jekyll.
Install the jekyll and bundler gems. gem install jekyll bundler
Create a new Jekyll site at ./mysite (use a better name of your choosing). jekyll new mysite
Change into your new directory. cd mysite
Build the site and make it available on a local server. bundle exec jekyll serve
Browse to http://localhost:4000(The prior text links to http://localhost:4000)
︗Publishing a Jekyll Site
We have instructions to get started here(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/docker/jekyll-builder) on how to publish your site to the Object Store.  It can be configured to publish automatically every time you push updates to GitLab.

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
You can compile Torch(The prior text links to http://torch.ch/) on our RHEL7 machines.  Please make sure to  contact staff if you have issues, as there are some local packages that are required and could cause the install to fail.
Note you have to use Cuda 8 or Cuda 7.5 when compiling Torch and that certain newer GPU cards are not supported under Cuda 7.5.  We will use Cuda 8 in this example.
First load the following software into your environment with GNU Modules.

module add cuda/8.0.61 cudnn zeromq nodejs sox GraphicsMagick 

Next we are going to create a python environment and active it (this assumes you are using the bash shell)

virtualenv env 
source env/bin/activate 

Then we are going to upgrade the python pip package manager and install two more dependencies

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pyzmq ipython

Next clone the repository from Torch ensuring you do it with the recursive option to get all its sub dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git torch --recursive 

Finally build Torch, this will take awhile.

cd torch && ./install.sh

At the end it will give you example of how to activate your Torch environment here is an example.

source install/bin/torch-activate

Now you can test you your install with the command th torch_test.th where the contents of the file torch_test.th are the following.

a = torch.Tensor(5,3)
a = torch.rand(5,3)
b = torch.rand(3,4)
c = torch.Tensor(5,4)
c:mm(a,b)

print(c)

require 'cutorch';
a = a:cuda()
b = b:cuda()
c = c:cuda()
c:mm(a,b)

print(c)

︗Introduction
UMIACS has deployed a system with 2 Barracuda Networks spam firewalls. This allows for enterprise level Virus and Spam scoring and filtering for our email architecture. You can log in to the system either of the 2 firewalls using your UMIACS email address (username@umiacs.umd.edu) and password:

bubs.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://bubs.umiacs.umd.edu)
pompom.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://pompom.umiacs.umd.edu)
︗Mail Flow Through Barracudas
The first time your mail flows through one of the Barracudas it will send you a mail with a new username and password. Subsequently you will receive every day (unless you configure otherwise) a mail at approx. 3:30pm EST from the Barracuda with your quarantine summary. Please note that auto log-in through the link provided in the summary does not work due to a recent firmware upgrade on the Barracudas. Please use the links provided above to log in.
︗Scoring
The Barracudas will score every message that passes through them and inject varying message headers based on that score.  You can then create email filters based on these headers to filter out messages that are tagged as spam by the Barracudas. See BarracudaSpamFirewall/Scoring for more details.

︗Quarantine
Mail that has been deemed as spam will be kept on the Barracudas in quarantine.  It will not be delivered to your mailbox unless you configure the Barracudas to do so.
Your quarantine will be preserved for 21 days. If mail is held for longer, then it will be purged.
If you receive a security warning in your browser after clicking this link, you may need to add the UMIACS Certificate Authority
You can search your spam quarantine with the following steps BarracudaSpamFirewall/SearchingQuarantine
︗Quarantine Passthrough
If you wish to have the mail that would ordinarily be quarantined by Barracuda delivered to your mailbox instead you can configure this using the Barracuda web configuration.
You can enable this functionality with the following guide BarracudaSpamFirewall/QuarantinePassthrough
︗None
You may also setup whitelists, blacklists, and Bayesian filtering options through the Preferences tab at the top of the Barracuda web portal.

Instructions to install RStudio on Windows

︗Contents

1 Requirements
2 Retrieving Installation Files
3 Using the Installer
4 Running RStudio


︗Requirements
To use RStudio, you will need an R environment set up. See:  Installing R for Windows.

︗Retrieving Installation Files
Visit http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/(The prior text links to http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
There are two ways to install RStudio:

The installer, which is found under Installers for Supported Platforms; click the appropriate Windows download link, and run the installer
The archive, which is found under Zip/Tarballs; click the appropriate Windows download link, and extract the archive contents to an installation directory of your choice
It is recommended to use the second option, as this will allow you to skip this next section (go directly to  Running RStudio). If using the installer, proceed to the next section.

︗Using the Installer
After retrieving the .exe installer, run it. Step through the installation while following the below steps.
When prompted for an install location, specify a location within your home directory. Remember this location.
The image is a screenshot of the RStudio installation setup window on a Windows operating system. At the top, the title "RStudio Setup" is displayed, indicating the purpose of the window. The interface is simple and utilitarian, featuring a blue circular icon representing the RStudio logo. Below the title, a prompt reads, "Choose Install Location," requesting the user to select a destination folder for the RStudio installation.

The main section of the window shows the default installation path: "C:\users\username\Documents\RStudio." A "Browse" button is available, allowing users to choose an alternative location if desired. Below the destination folder path, there are two lines indicating system requirements: "Space required: 407.7 MB" and "Space available: 169.8 GB," which inform the user of the storage needs for the installation.

Three buttons are located at the bottom left: "< Back," "Next," and "Cancel," facilitating navigation through the setup process. The window appears to be part of a standard installer interface with a neutral background and clear fonts, characteristic of software installations on Windows systems.
On the next install step, checking "Do not create shortcuts" is recommended, as the RStudio folder it creates will likely just be empty.
The image shows a screenshot of the "RStudio Setup" installation window on a Windows operating system. At the top, the title "Choose Start Menu Folder" indicates the purpose of this setup step. The interface has a light gray background, contributing to a clean and utilitarian aesthetic typical of software installers.

Below the title, there is a prompt instructing the user to select or create a folder for RStudio shortcuts. A drop-down menu displays potential folders, including "RStudio," "7-Zip," "Games," and several others, suggesting existing programs installed on the user's system.

To the left of the drop-down menu, the user can check or uncheck a box labeled "Do not create shortcuts," which is checked in this instance, indicating a preference not to create a shortcut for RStudio in the Start Menu. The bottom of the window includes navigation buttons: "< Back," "Install," and "Cancel," allowing users to return to the previous step, proceed with the installation, or exit the setup, respectively. The software’s version information, "Nullsoft Install System v2.46," is noted at the bottom right corner.
Proceed with the finishing steps of the installation.

︗Running RStudio
Navigate to the directory you just installed RStudio to (this is the install location you specified in the installer, or the extraction destination of the archive). In this directory, open bin, and find the rstudio.exe file. Running this will open up RStudio. For convenience, it may be preferable to create a shortcut linking to this executable.
When RStudio first runs, it will prompt you for an R execution environment. Pick the third Choose a specific version of R option, click browse, navigate to the folder in which R was installed, and select this folder.
The image displays a window titled "Choose R Installation," part of the RStudio setup process on a Windows operating system. At the top, it emphasizes the requirement for an existing installation of R to proceed. Below the title, three radio button options allow the user to select the version of R to use: the first option is to use the machine's default 64-bit version of R, the second for the 32-bit version, and the third lets users specify a particular version of R they need. 

The third option is currently selected and prompts the user to browse for the R installation path, which is indicated by a blank text box to the right of the "Choose a specific version of R" label. Below this, two buttons, "OK" and "Cancel," facilitate user decisions, and a small checkbox includes a note suggesting that an installation of R is necessary for RStudio to function. The overall look is straightforward and user-friendly, adhering to standard software setup conventions on Windows, emphasizing functionality with a neutral background and clear text. The image is a screenshot of a file selection window titled "Choose R Directory" designed for a Windows operating system. The interface has a standard appearance typical of Windows file dialogs, featuring a top navigation bar with breadcrumbs indicating the path to "Downloads > R > R-3.2.0." On the left pane, there are shortcuts to common locations, such as "Downloads," "Documents," and "This PC."

The right pane displays a list of folders within the "R-3.2.0" directory, including "bin," "doc," "etc," "include," "library," "modules," "share," "src," "Tcl," and "tests," each represented by a folder icon. The columns label the "Name," "Date modified," and "Type," with the "Date modified" column showing the last updated date as "5/28/2015" for all listed folders.

At the bottom of the dialog, a text box denotes the folder path, with a blue-highlighted button labeled "Select Folder" and a "Cancel" option beside it, allowing the user to either confirm their selection or exit the dialog. The overall look is functional and intuitively designed, facilitating user interaction for selecting the R installation directory.
Make sure the folder selected directly contains folders such as bin and include, as RStudio does not recursively search the selected folder for a valid R build. Afterwards, if RStudio prompts you to, choose a version of R to use.
RStudio should now launch properly.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Rclone contains the following information: 






︗Rclone

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Rclone is a command line program useful for syncing files and directories. Its functionality is similar to rsync, but has additional capabilities that support cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Open Drive, Amazon S3, and many more. 
Below are directions on how to remote setup rclone on a headless machine. If you would like to set up specific Google Drive or Dropbox remotes, you can go directly to the section labeled "Google Drive" or "Dropbox".

︗Contents

1 Remote Setup on A Headless System

1.1 Rclone configuration file
1.2 Rclone authorize


2 Google Drive

2.1 Common Use
2.2 Creating a cronjob


3 Dropbox


︗Remote Setup on A Headless System
To remote setup rclone, you will first have to SSH into one of UMIACS' hosts and load the rclone module by typing module load rclone. If this does not work, check that the rclone module is available by running the command module avail rclone. If the module is not available, SSH to a host where it is.
If you are instead installing rclone on a system that you have administrative privileges on, downloads are available at https://rclone.org/downloads/(The prior text links to https://rclone.org/downloads/).
Once you have loaded the module or installed the software, there are two ways to remote configure rclone. The first is by copying the rclone config file, and the second is by using rclone authorize.

︗Rclone configuration file
To copy the rclone config file, first configure rclone on your desktop machine. This can be achieved by running the command rclone config to set up the file and then finding the location of the configuration file using the command rclone config file, which should yield output similar to what is below:

$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf

This file can then be transferred to the remote box using scp, copy/paste, ftp, sftp, etc. The command rclone config file can also be run on the remote box to find the correct location to which the file should be moved.

︗Rclone authorize
To configure using rclone authorize instead, run the command Remote config on your headless machine, and then select the option for working on a headless machine by answering the first prompt with an n. The resulting output should look like this:

Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n

For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.
Execute the following on your machine:
	rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
Then paste the result below:
result>

Next, on your main desktop machine, run the command rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive". Follow the link that the output directs you to; you should now have received a secret token on your desktop machine console, in a message similar to the one below:

rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Paste the following into your remote machine --->
SECRET_TOKEN
<---End paste

Go back to your headless machine and paste the secret message on the console where it says result>. Finally, approve the token by answering the prompts that follow:

result> SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
[acd12]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>

If there are any issues with the remote setup, visit https://rclone.org/remote_setup/(The prior text links to https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more information.

︗Google Drive
In order to sync files to Google Drive on Linux systems, use of the command line program Rclone is necessary. The first step is to SSH into one of UMIACS' hosts with X11 forwarding enabled (use the -XY flag) or (if the host is a workstation) log in over GUI and launch the terminal. If Rclone is already in the module tree, then load the Rclone module using:

module load rclone

If the module is NOT installed on the machine, install it from here: https://rclone.org/downloads/(The prior text links to https://rclone.org/downloads/)
Once installed, load into it using the previous command.
To make a new remote, run the command rclone config. This should produce output similar to what is below:

n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> 

Choose to make a new remote, and give it a name. There should then be prompt asking for the type of storage to configure. Input drive for Google Drive.

Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 1Fichier
   \ "fichier"
 2 / Alias for an existing remote
   \ "alias"
 ...
 ...
37 / premiumize.me
   \ "premiumizeme"
38 / seafile
   \ "seafile"
Storage> drive

When prompted for your Google Application Client Id and Secret, it is okay to leave those blank. Rclone will then prompt for a scope that it should use when requesting access from your drive, which you can provide by selecting one of the numbers on the screen. The suggested value for full operation is 1.

Google Application Client Id
Setting your own is recommended.
See https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id for how to create your own.
If you leave this blank, it will use an internal key which is low performance.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_id>
OAuth Client Secret
Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_secret>
Scope that rclone should use when requesting access from drive.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder.
   \ "drive"
 2 / Read-only access to file metadata and file contents.
   \ "drive.readonly"
   / Access to files created by rclone only.
 3 | These are visible in the drive website.
   | File authorization is revoked when the user deauthorizes the app.
   \ "drive.file"
   / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.
 4 | This is not visible in the drive website.
   \ "drive.appfolder"
   / Allows read-only access to file metadata but
 5 | does not allow any access to read or download file content.
   \ "drive.metadata.readonly"
scope> 1

You can leave the root_folder_id and the service_account_file blank. You will then be prompted to edit the advanced config. Enter the default value unless the application requires further customization.

Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n>

You will then be prompted to Use auto config. Enter Y.

Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n>

The window will then prompt for sign in with a Google account. Sign into your UMD account using your <DIRECTORYID>@umd.edu email. You will then be brought to the UMD CAS Dual Factor Authentication Screen. Sign in with your normal credentials and dual factor authenticate. Allow rclone to access your Google Account.
You will then be prompted to Configure this as a team drive. Enter the default value unless the application requires further customization.

Configure this as a team drive?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n>

Finally, confirm your selections if they are correct, edit them if they are incorrect.

--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y

︗Common Use
List directories in top level of your drive

rclone lsd <REMOTENAME>:

List all the files in your drive

rclone ls <REMOTENAME>:

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

rclone copy /home/source <REMOTENAME>:<NEWBACKUPNAME>

More commands and usage can be found at: https://rclone.org/drive/(The prior text links to https://rclone.org/drive/)

︗Creating a cronjob
A cronjob will allow you to automate backups. To create a cronjob for an Rclone command, first you must find the path of Rclone. This can be done using the which command.

[user@workstation ~]$ which rclone
/opt/common/rclone-v1.53.4-linux-amd64/rclone

Then use crontab -e to edit your crontab. Once in the crontab, you can input your Rclone command using the command path found previously. An example of an Rclone cronjob that would occur every hour on the hour would be:

0 * * * * /opt/common/rclone-v1.53.4-linux-amd64/rclone copy /<PATHTOBEBACKEDUP>/ <REMOTENAME>:<BACKUPNAME>

︗Dropbox
These instructions assume that you have SSH'd into one of UMIACS' hosts and have successfully been able to load the rclone module using the command module load rclone, or installed rclone yourself on a system that you have administrative privileges on. If this is not the case, please do so before proceeding with the Dropbox remote setup.
First, make a new remote by running the command rclone config. This should produce output similar to what is below:

n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> 

Choose to make a new remote, and give it a name. The setup will then prompt you to choose a type of storage to configure. You can either choose the number from the options that corresponds to "Dropbox", or simply type in dropbox. When prompted for your Dropbox App Key and Secret, it is okay to leave those blank. 
The console will then redirect you to a browser page that will prompt you to enter a code displayed on the console and authorize rclone for access. Once you have followed the instructions on the webpage, the console will display your credentials and ask for approval to confirm the remote.

︗Mathematica

From UMIACS
(Redirected from MathematicaActivation)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Mathematica is freely available to all University-owned machines. 
On our UMIACS-supported Linux hosts, Mathematica can be accessed through our Modules.

The command module add mathematica will add the default version of Mathematica to your Environment.
To see the versions of Mathematica that are available use the command module avail mathematica.
To add a specific version of Mathematica to your Environment (i.e. Mathematica 12.0) use the command module add mathematica/12.0
Further information can be found on our  Modules page.
For UMIACS-supported Windows machines, or other self-supported University-owned equipment, please contact  staff.

︗Activation
There is no automated way to activate Mathematica across our domain. As a result, each computer will have to be registered once against our hosted license server. Any user can go through this process, and it should persist indefinitely so long as the computer is not reinstalled.

Upon being prompted, click "Other ways to activate" in the bottom row: The image depicts a software activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10. The interface features a predominantly white background with a bold red header that displays the text "Wolfram Mathematica 10," signifying the version of the software. Below the header is a prompt that instructs the user to "Activate online" and type their activation key in a designated input field. The activation key is represented by placeholders indicating the expected format (e.g., "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX").

At the bottom of the window, there are three buttons labeled "Quit," "Other ways to activate," and "Activate." The button for "Other ways to activate" is highlighted with a black arrow pointing towards it, emphasizing its action. This suggests that there may be alternative methods for activation beyond the online option. Additional text is present, providing links to information about online activation and the Wolfram Privacy Policy, indicative of user support for software compliance. The overall design is clean and functional, intended for a straightforward user experience in activating the software.
Click "Connect to a network license server": The image displays a software activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10. The interface features a bright white background, accentuated by a bold red header that clearly states "Wolfram Mathematica 10," indicating the version. Below the header, a prompt guides users to select a method to activate the software. Three options are presented: 

1. **Online Activation (Recommended)**: This option suggests internet connectivity for activation.
2. **Manual Activation**: This option is intended for users experiencing issues with online activation.
3. **Connect to a network license server**: This method is highlighted with a black arrow pointing toward it, emphasizing its importance. The associated text encourages the user to utilize this method if connected to a network with MathLM, indicating this is the network license server needed for activation.

At the bottom, there's a "Quit" button facilitating the closing of the application. The overall design is minimalistic and functional, aimed at providing a user-friendly experience for software activation.
Enter "licserv.umiacs.umd.edu" as the license server. Click "Activate": The image showcases a software activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10, set against a blurred background that suggests a desktop environment. The interface predominantly features a bright white background, framed by a bold red header that states "Wolfram Mathematica 10" prominently at the top. Below this header, the window invites users to "Connect to a Network License Server," emphasizing the activation process.

Central to the interface is a text field labeled "Server name," with a placeholder text indicating the appropriate format: "Enter the name or IP address of the computer running the MathLM license server." The designated server name, "licserv.umiacs.umd.edu," is visible within the text field. 

At the bottom of the window, four buttons are arranged horizontally: "Quit," "Other ways to activate," "Activate," and the latter is highlighted with a black arrow pointing towards it, drawing attention to its importance in completing the activation process. The minimalist design of the window contributes to an intuitive user experience, aimed at guiding users efficiently through the activation requirements for the software.
Accept the terms, and click ok: The image features a software activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10, designed with a predominantly white background. At the top, a bold red header reads "Wolfram Mathematica 10," clearly indicating the software version. The main area of the window presents the Mathematica License Agreement, instructing users to read and accept the terms before proceeding with the activation process.

The text is structured with a clear heading, "ACCEPTANCE," followed by a brief description of the agreement. Below this, a checkbox is prominently displayed, which users must select to indicate their acceptance of the terms. The label beside the checkbox reads, "I accept the terms of this agreement," emphasizing its importance.

At the bottom of the window, three buttons are arranged horizontally: "Quit," "Print," and "OK." The "OK" button is highlighted for visibility, indicating the next step in the activation process. The overall design is functional, aiming to facilitate an efficient user experience while ensuring compliance with licensing requirements. The color scheme enhances readability and user engagement.
Mathematica should now be activated on the computer.

On any RedHat host we have support for using the new  Intel® C/C++ Composer XE for Linux and Intel® Fortran Composer XE for Linux and some of the older version of the C/C++ and Fortan compilers that were shipped by Intel.
To setup your environment you will need to either load a  GNU Module file or source some config files depending on your shell and architecture.

︗Module File
Rather than sourcing the scripts as mentioned below, you can load a pre-configured  GNU Module file to the same end. You can run the following on RHEL7+/Ubuntu hosts to prepare your environment for either C/C++ or Fortran compilation:

   module load intel/2020.1

/opt/common/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.1.106

To use a version you need to source the bin/iccvars.csh for tcsh/csh users or bin/iccvars.sh for bash users.  Additionally you need to specify the architecture on the command line when sourcing. For 32bit users that is ia32 and for 64bit that is intel64.
Example for a tcsh/csh user using the 64bit 13.1.1 version of the compiler on a RHEL7+ host:

  source /opt/common/intel/composer_xe_2013_sp1.1.106/bin/iccvars.csh intel64

You can then use the icpc to compile with the Intel C++ Compiler or icc to compile with the Intel C Compiler.

SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol)) is a network protocol used to securely transfer and manage files on remote systems.  SFTP is layered on top of the SSH protocol, and is preferred over FTP as a method of remote file transfer.
Warning: running interactive programs in your shell initialization files, such as starting another shell, causes SFTP to fail. See Shell on how to correctly change the shell you are using

︗Connecting to an SFTP Server
Under Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to a remote host.

sftp bkirz@$HOSTNAME.umiacs.umd.edu 
Replace $HOSTNAME with the name of the host you are trying to connect.
For UMIACS supported Windows hosts, a SFTP client is already installed. For other hosts, you can download and install winSCP(The prior text links to http://winscp.net/eng/download.php), which will enable SSH and SFTP access.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SetGID contains the following information: 






︗SetGID

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The setgid bit works in two ways, one for files and one for directories.

︗SetGID Files
The setgid bit for files will force when a file is executed to set its group ID to the GID that of the binary instead of the user that is running it.  This mode has no effect for files that are not executable.  To a lesser extent than SetUID this can lead to security issues when the group in question has some files that would be allowed to be read or written when otherwise not permitted.  There are very limited uses for this feature these days and its use is discouraged.

︗SetGID Directories
SetGID directories have a much more benign behavior.  When this bit is set on a directory all filesystem creations underneath that directory will inherit the group from the directory.  UMIACS policy is to keep users' default UID and GID.  So for users who wish to have certain directory trees have consistent groups the use of SetGID directories is useful.  The SetGID directory bit will force all files created under that directory to have the same GID.  Any directories created will also be given the same GID and the SetGID bit so that the same policy is applied at the next level of directory down.
Before we give an example of how to use the sticky bit please see the documentation about umask.  SetGID will only work on the GID and the setting a sticky bit and will not change any other permissions.  By default the umask is 022 and is a bit too restrictive for the use of SetGID effectively.  (002 or 007 will be the appropriate setting depending if you want Others to be able to read/execute or not)
First an example of what our default group is and what other groups we belong to:

[username@novelty ~/staff]$ id
uid=9001(username) gid=29001(username) groups=15114(umadmin),29001(username)

Now we have created a directory called staff that we want to share with the umadmin group (which is not my default group)

[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .
drwxr-xr-x  2 username username   96 Jun 16 11:34 .

We are going to set the new group to umadmin and set rwxrwxr-x permissions.  Then finally we will add the SetGID bit.

[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chgrp umadmin .
[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod 775 .
[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod g+s .

Now you can see we have a directory that is correctly set up,

[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .
drwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 11:34 .

We are going to use umask of 002 since we want to allow others to read the files.
We are going to now create a test file and test directory,

[username@novelty ~/staff]$ touch test
[username@novelty ~/staff]$ mkdir testdir

Now as you can see we have the correct groups and permissions being used to create both files directories,

[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la
drwxrwsr-x  3 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 .
-rw-rw-r--  1 username umadmin    0 Jun 16 12:58 test
drwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 testdir

︗UMIACS Object Store
An object store is a web-based storage solution focused on reliability, scalability and security. It is best suited for public content storage/distribution, archiving data or secure data sharing between users. Our Object Store can be used through the web interface(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj), the command line UMobj utilities, third-party graphical  clients, and even programmatically using many popular programming languages.  We support a subset of the Amazon Simple Storage Services (S3) API(The prior text links to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), built around a technology called Ceph(The prior text links to http://ceph.com/).

︗Terminology
S3-like storage thinks in terms of buckets and keys. Keys are analogous to files. A bucket is simply a container to a set of keys. There is no actual hierarchy inside of a bucket, but the standard UNIX path separator, a forward slash (/) at the end of a Key name, is interpreted by many clients (including this web site and our UMobj utilities) as being a directory delimiter. This allows you to copy data from your local filesystems to your buckets through umobj or third-party clients. You may specify who has what types of access to your buckets via Access Control Lists (ACLs) at the bucket level or the individual key level.
Your data is protected from individual machine failure via replication within the cluster. All data is checksummed in accordance with the Amazon S3 protocol to ensure that data in transit is valid before it is accepted by the cluster. However, there are no backups or snapshots of this data in the cluster, so if a user deletes a key or bucket in the Object Store, there is no way to restore that information.

︗Getting Started
UMIACS users are allocated 50GB of storage.  Faculty are allocated 10TB. To get started, log in(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj) and you will be redirected to the initial help page.  You can also find the link from our https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu) site as "OBJbox Object Store".

︗Buckets
You can create and browse your buckets (containers that hold data) by visiting your buckets(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/) page. You can also set bucket-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) from this page. Bucket-level ACLs get implicitly inherited to all the keys within the bucket. However, individual keys can have additional specific ACLs applied for more granular control.
Bucket names must be unique. When you create a bucket it will notify you if the name is already taken.

︗None
After selecting a bucket, you will be able to create folders and upload files within that bucket. Listed files can be downloaded, deleted, or assigned a specific ACL by the key owner/creator.
Please note: Local file system ownership and permissions, and special files (such as symlinks) can not be represented in the Object Store. We highly suggest that if you are securing data into the Object Store and need these to be faithfully maintained that you use a local archive tool (tar, zip, etc..) to collect the data and then upload the resulting archive file(s).

︗Hosting a Website in your Bucket
Please visit OBJ/WebHosting for more information.

︗None
Within the web interface you can delete files one-by-one. If you want to remove a bunch of files, you will need to use a different client as described below.
This is dangerous as there are no backups of files in the Object Store. Be careful to only delete the data you intend to delete.

︗Clients
There are several clients that can be used (sometimes with a limited set of features) on your desktop to gain access to the Object Store. All supported UMIACS systems running RHEL8 have a copy of our UMobj(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj) utilities preinstalled which provide command line access to the Object Store. We also have an article in our wiki on  third party clients that lists and explains the details. These clients need to be configured with your Access and Secret Keys as described below.

︗Access Key and Secret Key
Each user has one or more pairs of Access Keys and Secret Keys that are used as a credential to not expose your password when using the Object Store. These can be obtained by clicking on your username(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/user/) in the upper right-hand corner. You'll use these to identify and authenticate yourself to the Object Store.
Please treat your Secret Key(s) the same as a password and do not plaintext it over email/otherwise or share it with any other individuals.
When using the umobj(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj) utilities, you will need to make sure you have added these credentials in your local shell initialization files. There are links to files that have these automatically generated for the 3 most popular UNIX shell families (bash/sh, csh/tcsh, and zsh). Please make sure that whatever file(s) you copy these credentials into can not be read by other users (eg. chmod 600 filename).
Note: Each Access Key and Secret Key are specific to a particular object store, so if you are accessing multiple object stores you may want to write the credentials for each to separate files and then source each file when you want to use the associated object store. Please  contact staff if you have any questions.

︗LabGroups
LabGroups allow a group of users to share data while avoiding the need for complex ACLs by maintaining group ownership. Designated LabGroup managers can grant granular access (read, write, full control, manager) to buckets owned by the LabGroup. All objects owned by a LabGroup count against the group quota. LabGroups can be navigated using the menu with username in the top right corner of the page. Note: this will only appear if you are a member of at least one LabGroup. At this point, you can browse the Object Store as the LabGroup and obtain your unique Access Key and Secret Key pair using the instructions above. To switch to another LabGroup or back to your own buckets, click the menu again and select another user or group.

︗Managing LabGroups
LabGroups have many different levels of membership: Managers, FULL_CONTROL, READ/WRITE, and READ. Managers can add or remove LabGroup Members while every other access level cannot. If you hold the Manager role in a LabGroup, you can add and remove users using the Manage LabGroups(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/labgroup/list/) page, which is available under the Manage menu at the top of the page. After selecting a LabGroup, you can add users by typing their username into the search field and selecting a membership role.

︗Requesting a LabGroup
To request a LabGroup for your project, please  contact staff.

︗Fixing Stuck Standing Desk

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
If your electric adjustable standing desk is stuck, and will no longer move when the up / down button is pressed, try the following steps:


 Disconnect the table from outlet / power source 
 Disconnect the controller cable (blue end) from the power box located either underneath desktop or to desk frame
 Disconnect both table leg cables from the M1 and M2 connectors 
 Connect the cable from the table leg on the same side as the up / down controls to the M1 connector 
Note: You must connect  a cable to the M1 connector BEFORE connecting anything to the M2 connector
 Connect the cable from the second leg to the M2 connector 
 Reconnect the controller cable (blue end) 
 Reconnect the table to outlet / power source 
 Press and hold the down button for 5 seconds, after which you should feel a very slight movement 
Note: It is very important that the down button be held for the full 5 seconds

︗Issues After Steps Above
If your desk either moves in the opposite direction of button pressed, or only moves a short distance before stopping and becoming stuck again, repeat steps listed above but switching which legs go to the M1 and M2 connectors.  This will result in the leg on the OPPOSITE side of the up/down controls being connected to the M1 connector first, then the leg on the same side as the up/down controls being connected second.

︗WebSensitiveInformation

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
︗Overview
In order to maintain maximum security, we do not store any sensitive information on our web servers. Such information is encrypted in memory upon receipt and sent to a designated email address, the owner of which will decrypt it using a email encryption/decryption program.
The recommended email encryption/decryption software at UMIACS is WinPT (Windows Privacy Tray), a small and powerful software from http://winpt.wald.intevation.org/(The prior text links to http://winpt.wald.intevation.org/). It is freely available to all users. It must be noted that you need GnuPG 1.4.11 or higher installed on your computer to use WinPT. You can download GnuPG for free from the GnuPG website(The prior text links to https://www.gnupg.org/).

︗WinPT Instructions
The first time you run this program, you will be asked to generate your "keypair". A keypair contains a public key, which is usually used for encryption, and a private key, which is used for decryption.
Now you are ready to encrypt and decrypt messages. To do so: 

Simply copy the text you wish to encrypt/decrypt into the Windows clipboard (i.e., use "copy" or "ctrl-v")
Click on the WinPT icon in the lower-right corner of the screen
Select the approriate menu item
Follow the on-screen prompts.
To have others send you encrypted messages, you must give them your public key. To do so:
export your public key (There are three different ways to do this, reference this manual(The prior text links to http://www.mavi1.org/web_security/cryptography/pgp/gnupg-frontend/WinPT/winpt-handbook-0.2rc2.pdf) to decide which is best for you.), and send it to the other side. Never distribute your private key.
In the case of the standard UMIACS setup for accepting sensitive information online, such as credit card information, social security number, etc, it is mandatory that we use encrypted messages. Send your public key to webmaster@umiacs.umd.edu and clearly indicate which online form this is for.

︗Extra Links
For an even more in-depth guide, consult this(The prior text links to http://sebsauvage.net/winpt_en.html) over-simplified WinPT Tutorial.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SecureShell contains the following information: 






︗SecureShell

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Secure Shell (or SSH(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) is a network protocol allowing two computers to exchange data securely over an insecure network.  By default, use of SSH brings the user to a terminal, but the protocol can be used for other types of data transfer such as SFTP and SCP.

︗Contents

1 Connecting to an SSH Server
2 X11 Forwarding
3 SSH Tunneling
4 SSH Keys (and Passwordless SSH)
5 Verify remote host SSH fingerprint

5.1 Windows / PuTTY Verification
5.2 Other Platforms


6 Long Running Processes
7 Further Information


︗Connecting to an SSH Server
Under Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus.

# ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
Note: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.

This will give you access to a terminal on any one of the Nexus servers.  Note that by default you will not have access to applications that require X11 to run.
All UMIACS-supported Windows hosts are installed with PuTTY(The prior text links to http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/). If you are using a self-supported machine, you can either download and install PuTTY yourself, or if you are running a currently supported version of Windows(The prior text links to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education), you can install the OpenSSH client natively in Windows by following Microsoft's instructions here(The prior text links to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). Only the client is needed and not the server.

︗X11 Forwarding
By default, SSH only gives the user shell access to a host.  Enabling X11 Forwarding allows users to run applications with Graphical User Interfaces.
Under Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus using X11 Forwarding. Please note that under macOS, xQuartz(The prior text links to http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) is required on the client machine to forward X sessions from the remote session.

# ssh -Y username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
Note: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.

Under Windows, you will need to forward X through VcXsrv(The prior text links to http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) or another X11 application.
If using PuTTY, you will need to enable X forwarding. The option is under Connection > SSH > X11, shown below.
The image is a screenshot of the PuTTY Configuration window, specifically showcasing the settings for X11 forwarding. The window is predominantly gray with a clear, organized layout. On the left side, there is a vertical navigation pane titled "Category," with expandable sections for different configuration options, including "Session," "Terminal," "Window," "Connection," and more, each indicated by a dropdown arrow.

In the main area, the focus is on the "Options controlling SSH X11 forwarding." Here, a checkbox labeled "Enable X11 forwarding" is checked, indicating that this option is activated. Below it, there are fields for "X display location" and a dropdown for "Remote X11 authentication protocol", displaying two options: "MIT-Magic-Cookie-1" and "XDM-Authorization-1." Additionally, there is a "Browse..." button next to the "X authority file for local display" field, suggesting the user can select a file for configuration purposes.

At the bottom-right corner of the window, there are buttons labeled "Open," "Cancel," and "Help," allowing the user to proceed or exit the configuration. The overall aesthetic is functional, catering to users configuring SSH sessions for graphical applications.
If using the Windows Terminal app(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install), you will need to set an environment variable and then relaunch the app.

setx.exe DISPLAY "127.0.0.1:0.0"
After this has been done, every time you want to use X forwarding, you need to make sure VcXsrv or your other application has been started. If using VcXsrv, there will be an icon in your system tray.
You will now be able to use Xwindow programs from your SSH client.

︗SSH Tunneling
You can tunnel one or more ports through an SSH connection such that your packets will look like they are coming from the host you are tunneling to.   This is helpful for services that you would be normally blocked by a firewall.
Please see the SecureShellTunneling page for more information.

︗None
SSH can utilize public key encryption to authenticate and authorize users. This can be considered more secure especially if you secure your private key with a pass-phrase. The keys themselves are not susceptible to brute force attacks like normal passwords over SSH are.
Please see the SSH/Keys page for more information.
Note: UMIACS still requires multi-factor authentication if you are connecting from the public internet for security reasons. If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.

︗Verify remote host SSH fingerprint
The SSH protocol relies on host keys to verify the identify of a given host.  Each host as a unique key for the various different protocols supported.  
When connecting to a remove host for the first time, or when the remote host's local host key configuration has changed, you may see the following prompt:

$ ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
The authenticity of host 'nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.73)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

It is considered best practice to verify the key fingerprint with the actual key of the host.  UMIACS maintains a reference of SSH key fingerprints available at the following link: 
https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys)
It is important to note that each key type has a different fingerprint.  Depending on your local configuration, your client may prefer a specific type of key.  The following commands can be used to determine the fingerprint of a given key type on a remote host:

$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu > key
# nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0
$ ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f key
2048 MD5:25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (RSA)

If you have any questions, or notice a discrepancy, please  contact staff.

︗None
If you use PuTTY to connect to remote hosts, the prompt will be similar to the following:
The image displayed is a screenshot of the "PuTTY Security Alert" dialog box. The window has a predominantly white background with a yellow triangle warning symbol positioned at the top left, indicating a security concern. The text within the box explains that the server's host key is not cached in the registry, warning the user that they cannot guarantee the identity of the connecting server.

The message details the server's host key fingerprint, formatted in a mixed case and displayed prominently, which is crucial for authenticating the server. Below the alert message, there are three buttons: "Yes," "No," and "Cancel," each allowing the user to respond to the security prompt.

- **"Yes"**: Click this if the user trusts the host, which will add the key to PuTTY's cache and allow the connection to continue.
- **"No"**: This option permits the user to connect without caching the key, useful for a one-time connection.
- **"Cancel"**: Selecting this will abort the connection entirely.

Overall, the design of the dialog is functional and intended to inform the user about server authentication, emphasizing the importance of verifying the server's identity before proceeding with the connection.
If the host key reported by PuTTY matches the Documented entry for that host(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/ssh-fingerprints/blob/master/fingerprints), it is safe to click 'yes'.  If they do not match, please report the issue to staff@umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu).

︗Other Platforms
WinSCP(The prior text links to https://winscp.net/eng/docs/faq_hostkey)
MobaXterm(The prior text links to https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
︗Long Running Processes
If you are dealing with a long running process that is inhibiting your ability to work regularly, you may want to run your processes inside a screen on the host that you're connecting to. This way, if the connection is dropped for any reason the screen session will automatically detach on the host and will continue running so that you can reattach it at a later time when you've connected again. Please see our documentation on  GNU Screen for more information.

︗Nexus/Vulcan

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The compute nodes from Vulcan's previous standalone cluster have folded into Nexus as of the scheduled  maintenance window for August 2023 (Thursday 08/17/2023, 5-8pm).
The Nexus cluster already has a large pool of compute resources made possible through college-level funding for UMIACS and CSD faculty. Details on common nodes already in the cluster (Tron partition) can be found  here.
Please  contact staff with any questions or concerns.

︗Contents

1 Usage
2 Nodes
3 Partitions
4 Accounts
5 QoS
6 Storage

6.1 Home Directories
6.2 Scratch Directories

6.2.1 Network Scratch Directory
6.2.2 Local Scratch Directories


6.3 Datasets
6.4 Project Storage
6.5 Object Storage


7 Migration

7.1 Home Directories




︗Usage
You can SSH to nexusvulcan.umiacs.umd.edu to log in to a submission host.
If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:

nexusvulcan00.umiacs.umd.edu
nexusvulcan01.umiacs.umd.edu
All partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone Vulcan cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named vulcan in the standalone cluster (it is also named just vulcan in Nexus).
Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:



Standalone Vulcan cluster submission command

Nexus cluster submission command


srun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash

srun --partition=vulcan-dpart --qos=vulcan-medium --account=vulcan-abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash


srun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash

srun --partition=vulcan-cpu --qos=vulcan-cpu --account=vulcan --pty bash


srun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash

srun --partition=vulcan-scavenger --qos=vulcan-scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash

Vulcan users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on Vulcan nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the vulcan-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all vulcan## in aggregate nodes plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan.
Please note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).

︗Nodes
There are currently 46  GPU nodes available running a mixture of NVIDIA RTX A6000, NVIDIA RTX A5000, NVIDIA RTX A4000, NVIDIA Quadro P6000, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, and NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards. There are also 4 CPU-only nodes available.
All nodes are scheduled with the SLURM resource manager.

︗Partitions
There are three partitions available to general Vulcan SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.

vulcan-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed. Only nodes with GPUs from architectures before NVIDIA's Ampere architecture(The prior text links to https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/) are included in this partition.
vulcan-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other vulcan- partitions are ready to be scheduled.
vulcan-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.
There are a few additional partitions available to subsets of Vulcan users based on specific requirements.

vulcan-ampere - This partition contains nodes with GPUs from NVIDIA's Ampere architecture(The prior text links to https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/). Job allocations are guaranteed.
As of Thursday 02/29/2024 at 12pm, there is a 4 hour time limit on interactive jobs in this partition. If you need to run longer jobs, you will need to modify your workflow into a job that can be submitted as a batch script.
As of Thursday 03/21/2024 at 5pm, there is a limit of 4 CPUs and 48G memory maximum per GPU requested by a job. If you need to run jobs with more CPUs/memory, you will either need to request more GPUs in the job or use a different partition.
Submission is restricted to the Slurm  accounts of the faculty who invested in these nodes:
Abhinav Shrivastava (vulcan-abhinav)
Jia-Bin Huang (vulcan-jbhuang)
Christopher Metzler (vulcan-metzler)
Matthias Zwicker (vulcan-zwicker)
︗Accounts
Vulcan has a base SLURM account vulcan which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in Vulcan compute infrastructure have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster.
If you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the vulcan account.  If your faculty sponsor has their own account, it is recommended to use that account for job submission.
The current faculty accounts are:

vulcan-abhinav
vulcan-djacobs
vulcan-jbhuang
vulcan-lsd
vulcan-metzler
vulcan-rama
vulcan-ramani
vulcan-yaser
vulcan-zwicker

︗QoS
You need to decide the QOS to submit with which will set a certain number of restrictions to your job.  If you do not specify a QoS when submitting your job using the --qos parameter, you will receive the vulcan-default QoS assuming you are using a Vulcan account.
The following sacctmgr command will list the current QOS.  Either the vulcan-default, vulcan-medium, or vulcan-high QOS is required for the vulcan-dpart partition.  Please note that only faculty accounts (see above) have access to the vulcan-high QoS.
The following example will show you the current limits that the QOS have. The output is truncated to show only relevant Vulcan QoS.

︗Storage
Vulcan has the following storage available.  Please also review UMIACS  Local Data Storage policies including any volume that is labeled as scratch.
Vulcan users can also request  Nexus project allocations.

︗Home Directories
You have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.
Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.
NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.

︗Scratch Directories
Scratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Vulcan compute infrastructure:

Network scratch directory
Local scratch directories
︗Network Scratch Directory
You have 300GB of scratch storage available at /vulcanscratch/<username>.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.
You may request a temporary increase of up to 500GB total space for a maximum of 120 days without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  Once the temporary increase period is over, you will be contacted and given a one-week window of opportunity to clean and secure your data before staff will forcibly remove data to get your space back under 300GB.  If you need space beyond 500GB or for longer than 120 days, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory.
This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.

︗Local Scratch Directories
Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage their data within the confine of their job and stage the data out before the end of their job.
These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month at 1am.  Different nodes will run the maintenance jobs on different days of the month to ensure the cluster is still highly available at all times.  Please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.

︗Datasets
We have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/vulcan-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.
The list of Vulcan datasets we currently host can be viewed here(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Vulcan).

︗Project Storage
Users within the Vulcan compute infrastructure can request project based allocations for up to 10TB for up to 180 days by  contacting staff with approval from the Vulcan faculty manager (Dr. Shrivastava).  These allocations will be available from /fs/vulcan-projects and /fs/cfar-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 180 days (requires re-approval from Dr. Shrivastava).

If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.
If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.
Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.

︗Object Storage
All Vulcan users can request project allocations in the UMIACS Object Store(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help). Please  contact staff with a short project name and the amount of storage you will need to get started.
To access this storage, you'll need to use a  S3 client or our UMobj command line utilities.
An example on how to use the umobj command line utilities can be found  here.  A full set of documentation for the utilities can be found on the umobj Gitlab page(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj).

︗Migration
︗Home Directories
The Nexus uses NFShomes home directories - if your UMIACS account was created before February 22nd, 2023, you were using /cfarhomes/<username> as your home directory on the standalone Vulcan cluster. While /cfarhomes is available on Nexus, your shell initialization scripts from it will not automatically load. Please copy over anything you need to your /nfshomes/<username> directory at your earliest convenience, as /cfarhomes will be retired in a two phase process:

Fri 11/17/2023, 5pm: cfarhomes directories are made read-only
Thu 12/21/2023, 5-8pm (monthly maintenance window): cfarhomes directories are taken offline

︗Installation
This page outlines the steps required to install MongoDB on a supported workstation.
We are no longer supporting MongoDB due to changes in their licensing a few years ago, but you can install MongoDB as a tarball using the following links:

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat-tarball/(The prior text links to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat-tarball/)
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/configuration/#std-label-base-config(The prior text links to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/configuration/#std-label-base-config)
︗Steps
Download the right Community Server file from the MongoDB Community download page(The prior text links to https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and place it in a directory you own. For most people this file will be:
Version: Current
Platform: RedHat / CentOS 7.0
Package: tgz
You will need to create a custom mongod.conf configuration file, using the second link above as a guide. The important thing is to set a custom path for systemPath and dbPath. These must be directories that you own. Other than that, they can be anything you choose.
Start the mongo server: "/path/to/bin/mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf". Since you are using a custom .conf file you will need to specify this when starting/stopping the server.
Start the mongo client: "/path/to/bin/mongo".
Once you are done, you can stop the server with "/path/to/bin/mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf --shutdown".

 Recording and Streaming
 Using Zoom
︗Contents

1 ATL 3100A

1.1 Sources

1.1.1 Room PC
1.1.2 Solstice

2.1 Sources

2.1.1 Room PC
2.1.2 Laptop
2.1.3 Solstice


2.2 Shutting Down




︗ATL 3100A
This conference room comes equipped with a touch panel that can be used to control the video and audio source(s) and level(s) being used to project to the displays in the room. There is a Room PC ("PC Main"), a Solstice Pod ("Solstice"), and an HDMI cable to use a laptop or external device ("Laptop").
There is also an "Audio Override" output device that you can project any of the input sources to. This decouples the source audio from the source video so that you can send audio from one source to the audio output while maintaining video from a difference source. The primary use of this is to be able to prevent echoing and have teleconferencing participants be able to hear the room audience when using both a laptop and the room PC to present. With both devices in the same teleconference session, leave "Laptop" as the source video and switch the audio override to "PC Main" to display what is on the laptop but use the microphones spread throughout the room to hear the audience.
The image features a touchscreen interface from a Crestron control panel used in a conference room. The layout is neatly organized with a blue and gray color scheme. At the top, there is a prominent red button labeled "Shutdown A/V System" for quickly turning off the audio-visual equipment. Below this, two sections display options for controlling the room's display. 

The top section has icons for "Laptop Projector" and "Laptop Monitor." Below it, a circular icon labeled "Audio Override" is centrally placed, allowing users to manage audio settings independently. The lower section presents additional source options: "PC Main," "Solstice," "Blank," and "Laptop," each represented by icons. A horizontal instruction beneath these buttons reads, "First Select a Source To Be Routed Below, then the Destination," indicating the operation flow for setting up the presentation. The overall user interface is designed for ease of use, allowing quick access to various inputs and settings during meetings.

︗Sources
︗Room PC
Use the wireless keyboard/mouse combo on the desk in the room to use the room PC. Choose the Conference account to sign into, which does not need a password. Please be sure to log off when you are done using the room PC, as the account is fully wiped when you log off, ensuring the next group using the room does not have access to anything you may have signed into.

︗Solstice
This option will prompt you to look at the display in the room for instructions on how to display your device(s) to the room's display wirelessly. More specific instructions can be found  here. Note that the IP address has been blacked out in the below photo for privacy reasons, but will show properly when you are physically in the room.
The image displays a digital screen interface for the "ATL3100a Pod," prominently labeled at the top in large, white lettering. The background features an abstract design with dark and multi-colored textures, resembling geological formations or a natural landscape, conveying a sense of depth and texture. In the center-right of the display is a list of connection instructions for users, written in clear, legible text. The instructions include three steps: "1. Connect your device to INTERNAL," "2. Browse to the address above," and "3. Connect." A visual cue is present for Apple users, indicating they can utilize AirPlay to connect to the "ATL3100a-Pod." 

The bottom of the screen displays the current time as "9:44 AM" and a numerical reference "3250." The weather icon and another indication at the bottom right symbolize the state of the device. The overall layout is user-friendly, designed for quick comprehension by users looking to connect their devices, with the combination of text and visual aids enhancing clarity and accessibility.

︗Laptop
Connect your device to the HDMI cable coming out of the middle of the desk in the room to display your device to the room's display over a wired connection.

︗Shutting Down
Please be sure to touch the "Shutdown A/V System" button when you are done using the room to save energy and give the next group using the room a clean slate. This will turn off the displays for the room and raise the projector screen.
The image displays a digital touchscreen interface from a Crestron control panel, oriented in landscape mode. The screen features a plain blue background with white text centered in the middle, stating "A/V System Shutting Down" followed by "Please Wait." Below the text, a loading spinner is visible, indicating that a process is in progress. The overall tone is professional and functional, suggesting that the system is in the process of powering down or executing an audio-visual shutdown command. 

At the top of the interface, a narrow black bar serves as a visual separator, while the bottom of the screen shows the manufacturer's name, "CRESTRON," subtly placed. The interface's minimalist design emphasizes clarity and usability, ensuring users easily recognize the shutdown message amid typical meeting room operations. This interface is likely part of a larger system controlling the room's multimedia functions, emphasizing the importance of systematic shutdown procedures for proper maintenance and energy conservation.

︗None
These conference rooms each come equipped with a simplified touch panel that can be used to control the video source being used to project to the display in the room as well adjust the audio level for the display. There is a Room PC ("Dedicated PC"), an HDMI cable to use a laptop or external device ("Table Laptop"), and a Solstice Pod ("Mersive Wireless").
The image depicts a digital touchscreen interface from a Crestron control panel installed in a conference room. The screen has a blue background with a grid layout featuring four selectable options displayed as buttons: "Dedicated PC," "Table Laptop," and "Mersive Wireless." Each button is clearly labeled in white text and is presented within a distinct rectangular shape, providing visual clarity. At the top of the interface, there is a "SYSTEM POWER" button, which likely controls the overall power status of the room's audio-visual equipment. 

To the right of the "SYSTEM POWER" button, there are icons for manipulating audio settings, including volume control represented by speaker symbols and a volume slider graphic. The interface is designed for intuitive use, allowing users to easily access different input sources for presentations. The overall layout and contrasting colors are chosen for readability and quick navigation, ensuring that users can efficiently manage the conference room's technology during meetings. The display is framed by a white casing, suggesting a modern and clean aesthetic ideal for professional environments.

︗RHEL7

From UMIACS
(Redirected from RedHat)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Red Hat Enterprise Linux(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux) 7 is an operating system published by Red Hat, Inc., which is currently a subsidiary of IBM.

︗Contents

1 Features
2 Kernel and Performance
3 Virtualization
4 File System Capabilities
5 Security


︗Features
A summary of important improvements are listed below.

︗Kernel and Performance
Based on Linux 3.10.0-957 kernel.
Initial process is changed to systemd.
Includes Security-Enhanced Linux(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux).
︗Virtualization
Users can run virtual machines within RHEL 7 using its built-in Kernel-based Virtual Machine(The prior text links to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_getting_started_guide/chap-virtualization_getting_started-products), or KVM. UMIACS also supports the use of Apptainer, a container application that is an alternative to Docker.

︗File System Capabilities
The default file system is now XFS. Here is an overview of the supported file systems in RHEL7. The information in this section is taken from this Redhat page(The prior text links to https://access.redhat.com/articles/796293) unless otherwise noted.

XFS(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS)
"[RHEL7] supports XFS filesystem sizes of up to 500 TB."
"XFS supports journaling to minimize data loss in the event of a system crash. Journal data are written to the log section while the file system is active and read when the filesystem is mounted (to recover any data not already written to disk)."
ext4(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4)
"The maximum standalone filesystem size for ext4 filesystems...[is]...50 TB."
Btrfs(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs)
This an "an unsupported Technology Preview," and should be used with caution.
︗Security
In addition to the standard Linux security architecture, RHEL7 includes Security-Enhanced Linux(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux), a module which implements a mandatory access control(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) model. Tutorials for configuring SELinux in RHEL are available here(The prior text links to https://access.redhat.com/articles/217213).

︗SLURM/Priority

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
SLURM at UMIACS is configured to prioritize jobs based on a number of factors, termed multifactor priority(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html) in SLURM. Each job submitted to the scheduler is assigned a priority value, which can be viewed in the output of scontrol show job <jobid>.
Example:

$ scontrol show job 1
JobId=1 JobName=bash
   UserId=username(13337) GroupId=username(13337) MCS_label=N/A
   Priority=10841 Nice=0 Account=nexus QOS=default
...

︗Contents

1 Pending Jobs
2 Priority Factors

2.1 Age
2.2 Association
2.3 Partition
2.4 Fair-share

2.4.1 GPU partitions
2.4.2 CPU-only partitions


2.5 Nice value




︗Pending Jobs
If the partition that you submit your job to cannot instantly begin your job due to no compute node(s) having the resources free to run it, your job will remain in the Pending state with the listed reason (Resources). If there is another job already pending with this reason, you submit a job to the same partition, and your job gets assigned a lower priority value than that pending job, your job will instead remain in the Pending state with reason (Priority). If there are multiple jobs pending and your job is not the highest priority job pending, the scheduler will only begin execution of your job if starting your job would not push the begin times for any higher priority jobs in the same partition further back.
Lowering some combination of the resources you are requesting and/or the time limit may allow submitted jobs to run more quickly or instantly during times where a partition is under resource pressure. The command squeue -j <jobid> --start can be used to provide a time estimate for when your job will start, where <jobid> is the job ID you receive from either srun or sbatch.
You can use the command alias  show_available_nodes with a variety of different submission arguments to get a better idea of what jobs may be able to begin sooner.

︗Priority Factors
The priority factors in use at UMIACS include:

Age of job i.e. time spent waiting to run in the queue
Association (SLURM account) being used
Partition job was submitted to
Fair-share of resources
"Nice" value that job was submitted with
︗Age
The longer a job is eligible to run but cannot due to resources being unavailable, the higher the job's priority becomes as it continue to wait in the queue. The priority modifier for this factor reaches its limit after 7 days.

︗Association
Some lab/center-specific SLURM accounts may have priority values directly attached to them. Jobs run under these accounts gain this many extra points of priority.

︗Partition
The partition named scavenger on each of our clusters always has a lower priority factor for its jobs than all other partitions on that cluster. As mentioned in other UMIACS cluster-specific documentation, jobs submitted to this partition are also preemptable(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html). These two design choices give the partition its name; jobs submitted to the scavenger partition "scavenge" for available resources on the cluster rather than consume dedicated resources, and are interrupted by jobs asking to consume dedicated resources.
On Nexus, labs/centers may also have their own scavenger partitions (<labname>-scavenger) if the faculty for the lab/center have decided upon some sort of limit on jobs (number of simultaneous jobs, number of actively consumed billing resources, etc.) in their non-scavenger partitions. These lab/center scavenger partitions allow for more jobs to be run by members of that lab/center on that lab's/center's nodes only, but are preemptable by that lab's/center's non-scavenger partition jobs.
In decreasing order of priority (highest first), our priority tiers for partitions are:

Account-specific non-preemptable partitions
Lab/center-specific non-"scavenger" named partitions
Lab/center-specific "scavenger" named partitions
Institute-wide scavenger partition
A job in a lower priority tier will never have a higher priority value than any job in any of the higher priority tiers.

︗Fair-share
The more resources your jobs have already consumed within an account, the lower priority factor your future jobs will have when compared to other users' jobs in the same account who have used fewer resources (so as to "fair-share" with other users). Additionally, if there are multiple accounts that can submit to a partition, and the sum of resources of all users' jobs within account A is greater than the sum of resources of all users' jobs within account B, the lower priority factor all future jobs from users in account A will have when compared to all future jobs from users in account B. (In other words, fair-share is hierarchical.)
You can view the various fair-share statistics with the command sshare -l. It will show your specific FairShare values (always between 0.0 and 1.0) within accounts that you have access to. You can also view other accounts' Level Fairshare (LevelFS).

The actual resource billing weights for the three main resources (memory per GB, CPU cores, and number of GPUs if applicable) are per-partition and can be viewed in the TRESBillingWeights line in the output of scontrol show partition. The billing value for a job is the sum of all resource weightings for resources the job has requested. This value is then multiplied by the amount of time a job has run in seconds to get the amount it contributes to the RawUsage for the association within the account it is running under.
The algorithm we use for resource weightings differs depending on if there are any GPUs in a partition or not, and is as follows:

︗GPU partitions
Each resource (memory/CPU/GPU) is given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (33.33% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU/GPU values are adjusted accordingly.
Different GPU types may also be weighted differently within the GPU relative billing. A baseline GPU type is first chosen. All GPUs of that type and other types that have lower FP32 performance (in TFLOPS(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS)) are given a weighting factor of 1.0. GPU types with higher FP32 performance than the baseline GPU are given a weighting factor calculated by dividing their FP32 performance by the baseline GPU's FP32 performance. The weighting values for each GPU type are then determined by normalizing the sum of all of GPU cards' billing values multiplied by their weighting factors against the relative billing percentage for GPUs (33.33%).
The current baseline GPU is the NVIDIA RTX A4000(The prior text links to https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a4000/).

︗CPU-only partitions
Each resource (memory/CPU) is first given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (50% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU value is adjusted accordingly. The final CPU weight value is then divided by 10, which ends up translating to roughly 90.9% of the billing weight being for memory and 9.1% being for CPU. The division of the CPU value is done so as to not affect accounts' fair-share priority factors as much when running CPU-only jobs given the popularity of GPU computing.

︗Nice value
This is a submission argument that you as the user can include when submitting your jobs to deprioritize them. Larger values will deprioritize jobs more e.g.,

srun --pty --nice=2 bash
will have lower priority than

srun --pty --nice=1 bash
which will have lower priority than

srun --pty bash
assuming all three jobs were submitted at the same time. You cannot use negative values for this argument.

︗ClassAccounts/Manage

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Class Accounts are provided through our Nexus infrastructure with a specific partition of nodes.  Each class will need to have the faculty member or TA(s) as the point of contacts for the class.  All students within the class will need to raise issues or questions through these points of contact who can relay or request support through our HelpDesk.  Please refer to the ClassAccounts documentation for further information.

︗Request New Class
If you are a faculty member teaching a class and want to use our resources, send email to staff@umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu) to create a ticket.  Please list or CC your TA(s) and what course you are teaching.  UMIACS staff will confirm the course through UMD Testudo and create the class within our Requests(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/class/) application.  We will associate you and your TA(s) with the class to be able to manage it through this application.  If your TAs do not have existing UMIACS accounts, please sponsor  collaborator accounts for each of them.
Please also mention any special storage allocation(s) you may need in your request.
Once the class is created, you and your TAs may want to create class accounts for yourselves (which is allowed).  This ensures you see the steps that students will see when getting their account(s) and give you the ability to test and manage any local resources for the class.

︗Management of Accounts
Once the class is created, accounts go through the following lifecycle.

Faculty/TAs create requests in our Requests(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/class/) application with the class dashboard.  This is done by entering a form with one or more email addresses.  We only support creating accounts for @umd.edu and @terpmail.umd.edu addresses.
Once a request for a student has been created from this email address, the student receives an email with a URL including a token that is only good for 7 days. Once they click this URL, they will be taken to a page to redeem their account by entering some information about themselves and selecting a password for their account.
If the student does not redeem their account, Faculty/TAs can go into the student's class account request in the app and renew their token.  This will invalidate the old token and issue a new token and then send a new email for account redemption.
Accounts that are redeemed will show up as pending in the Accounts Installed section of the class dashboard.  UMIACS Technical Staff will install class accounts that have been redeemed once per business day.  Once the account(s) are installed, they will be listed as installed on the class dashboard.  Each student will receive an email with information on getting started with their class account.
Note that class accounts also need to setup Duo multi-factor authentication in order to access the cluster.  Otherwise, they will see the message Access is not allowed because you are not enrolled in Duo. Please contact your organization's IT help desk. when trying to SSH to the class account login nodes.  Have them follow the instructions  here.
If a student does not provide a phone number when they redeem their account, they will not be able to reset their password automatically in the event that they forget it.  In this case, the TA will need to  contact staff and staff will advise on the steps.
Faculty/TAs will need to communicate any special instructions or information with their students on how to use the computational resources.
︗Deletion of Class
We will notify and clean up all class accounts after each major semester's completion. Class accounts are liable to be archived and deleted as early as follows:

Winter semesters: February 1st of same year
Spring semesters: June 1st of same year
Summer semesters: September 1st of same year
Fall semesters: January 1st of next year

︗Phishing

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Phishing attacks may be hard to distinguish from legitimate administrative messages, especially those in which the supposed UMIACS staff advise or require users to take administrative actions related to their account (e.g. storage quota, email account, or general account usage). 
Below are some helpful tips and practices that will make it easier to distinguish between legitimate UMIACS staff messages and phishing attempts.

︗Legitimate Mail from Staff
The UMIACS intranet site, intranet.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu) will always have a posted announcement of any administrative actions we wish all UMIACS users to take collectively. We suggest manually typing this address into your browser or having a bookmark for this site. This URL should also always be SSL-secured. Please check that your browser is reporting a secure connection when visiting the site. This will always be the case for any URL in the *.umiacs.umd.edu domain.
When we do send out requests for advisory and mandatory actions for a user they will usually be signed with a staff member's GPG key. We provide a tool called Verify Staff GPG Messages from the UMIACS intranet site (also linked below). This allows you to paste the text of the message and confirm that the sender is legitimate. Please note that other communications that are initiated by users through our Jira ticket system or in response to these tickets will not be signed.

Verify Staff GPG Messages(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/gpg/verify)
︗Some Telltale Signs of Phishing
The above steps should ensure that you are properly able to identify legitimate messages sent by staff. Below are some additional generic signs that should help identify phishing attempts.

Bogus to and from addresses (not within the UMIACS or UMD domains)
Message not directly referencing you by name (e.g. "Hello user" or "Hello researcher")
Sender of message demanding that action be taken immediately or consequences will occur (without an appropriate GPG key included)
Poor grammar and spelling in the message
Hyperlinks pointing to different locations than they claim to or shady attachments being included with the message
WARNING: Do NOT click on any links or open any attachments in a message you suspect to be a phishing attempt, as these may lead to the execution of malicious programs on your machine. Instead, hover over links to check where they really point to.
If you ever have questions about the legitimacy of a message, please contact the  Help Desk and we can verify whether or not it was sent out by staff.

︗If You Have Fallen Victim
If you believe you've fallen victim to a phishing attack or otherwise believe your account may have been compromised, please contact the  Help Desk immediately. The sooner we know about any potential issues, the sooner we can take preventive measures to make sure as little harm is done as possible. This typically will involve a password change as well as possibly locking out access to your account for some period of time while we ensure your account is secure.

︗Nexus/GAMMA

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation

The GAMMA(The prior text links to https://gamma.umd.edu/) lab has a partition of GPU nodes available in the Nexus. Only GAMMA lab members are able to run non-interruptible jobs on these nodes.

︗Contents

1 Access
2 Quality of Service
3 Hardware
4 Example
5 Storage

5.1 Home Directories
5.2 Project Directories
5.3 Scratch Directories

5.3.1 Network Scratch Directory
5.3.2 Local Scratch Directories


5.4 Datasets




︗Access
You can always find out what hosts you have access to submit via the Nexus#Access page.  The GAMMA lab in particular has a special submission host that has additional local storage available.

nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu
Please do not run anything on the login node. Always allocate yourself machines on the compute nodes (see instructions below) to run any job.

︗Quality of Service
GAMMA users have access to all of the  standard job QoSes in the gamma partition using the gamma account.
The additional job QoSes for the GAMMA partition specifically are:

huge-long: Allows for longer jobs using higher overall resources.
Please note that the partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on the partition-specific nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use.

︗Example
From nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu you can run the following example to submit an interactive job.  Please note that you need to specify the --partition and --account.  Please refer to our SLURM documentation about about how to further customize your submissions including making a batch submission.  The following command will allocate 8 GPUs for 2 days in an interactive session.  Change parameters accordingly to your needs.  We discourage use of srun and promote use of sbatch for fair use of GPUs.

$ srun --pty --gres=gpu:8 --account=gamma --partition=gamma --qos=huge-long bash

GPU 7: NVIDIA RTX A5000 (UUID: GPU-93170910-5d94-6da5-8a24-f561d7da1e2d)

You can also use SBATCH to submit your job.  Here are two examples on how to do that.

$ sbatch --pty --gres=gpu:8 --account=gamma --partition=gamma --qos=huge-long --time=1-23:00:00 script.sh

OR

$ sbatch script.sh

#SBATCH --gres=gpu:8
#SBATCH --account=gamma
#SBATCH --partition=gamma
#SBATCH --qos=huge-long
#SBATCH --time=1-23:00:00

python your_file.py

︗Storage
There are 3 types of user storage available to users in GAMMA:

Home directories
Project directories
Scratch directories
There is also read-only storage available for Dataset directories.
GAMMA users can also request  Nexus project allocations.

︗Home Directories
You have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.
Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.
NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.

︗Project Directories
You can request project based allocations for up to 8TB and up to 180 days with approval from a GAMMA faculty member.  
To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that approved the project in the conversation.  Please include the following details:

Project Name (short)
Description
Size (1TB, 2TB, etc.)
Length in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)
Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any
These allocations will be available from /fs/gamma-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation (requires re-approval from a GAMMA faculty member).

If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.
If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.
This data is backed up nightly.

︗Scratch Directories
Scratch data has no data protection, there are no snapshots and the data is not backed up. 
There are two types of scratch directories:

Network scratch directory
Local scratch directories
︗Network Scratch Directory
You are allocated 100GB of scratch space via NFS from /gammascratch/$username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.
This directory is automounted so you may not see your directory if you run ls /gammascratch but it will be mounted when you cd into your /gammascratch directory.
You may request a permanent increase of up to 200GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 200GB, you will need faculty approval. 
This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.

︗Local Scratch Directories
These file systems are not available over NFS and there are no backups or snapshots available for these file systems.

Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These directories are local to each node, ie. the /scratch0 on two different nodes are completely separate.
These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.
These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.
Gamma has invested in a 20TB NVMe scratch file system on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu that is available as /scratch1.  To utilize this space, you will need to copy data from/to this over SSH from a compute node.  To make this easier, you may want to setup SSH keys that will allow you to copy data without prompting for passwords.
The /scratch1 directory on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu doesn't have a tmpwatch. The files in this directory need to be manually removed once they are no longer needed.
︗Datasets
We have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/gamma-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.
The list of GAMMA datasets we currently host can be viewed here(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=GAMMA).

︗Introduction
Remote Desktop allows you to connect to another computer from a network that is compatible. Currently, at UMIACS, this feature is only supported for Windows hosts using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). If you need to remotely connect to a UNIX host, please see SecureShell. With RDP, you can control your Windows desktop environment through a graphical user interface. Mouse and keyboard movements are transferred over a network to a Windows host running an RDP server, which sends screen refreshes back. 
To access an RDP enabled machine, you must be on the UMIACS physical network or VPN. You must also be authorized to access and remotely control the host you are requesting. If a remote session is active, it is not possible for another user to log onto the console in-person. Attempting to use RDP when a computer is in use by another user could force the existing user to logoff and lose their work. You should always quit RDP by logging off of the remote computer. Simply quitting the RDP client can cause you to stay logged in and prevent other users from accessing the remote host, even at the physical console.

︗How to Connect
Prerequisites:
Connected to the  UMIACS VPN or be within the UMIACS network border.
Be a member of the 'Remote Desktop Users' group on the remote machine. Please  contact staff if you do not have remote access to a machine you feel you should.
︗Windows
For connecting to Windows client over RDP, we recommend the native Windows 'Remote Desktop Connection' client. 

To start the RDC client, click the "Start'" or "Windows" button on the taskbar. In the menu, navigate to "All Programs," "Accessories," then select "Remote Desktop Connection". Alternatively, you can search for "Remote Desktop Connection" in the Start menu's search field.
Once RDC client starts, type the name of the RDP/Windows host you are trying to access. The name should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN), e.g. desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu where desktop is replaced by the name of the desktop you are trying to connect to. At this point, click "Connect" to initiate the RDP session.
The image shows a user interface of the "Remote Desktop Connection" application on a Windows computer. The window features a blue and white color scheme with the title "Remote Desktop Connection" prominently displayed at the top. Below the title, there are input fields where a user can enter connection details. 

The first field labeled "Computer:" contains the text "desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu," which indicates the specific host name of the remote computer to connect to. The second field is labeled "User name:" and states "None specified," suggesting that the user has not yet entered their credentials. 

At the bottom of the window, there are two buttons: "Connect," which is highlighted in blue, and "Help," which is less emphasized. An option to expand further settings is indicated by the "Show Options" button in the bottom left corner. The overall layout is user-friendly and designed for inputting connection credentials to establish a remote session effectively.
Upon reaching the Windows Security prompt, enter your UMIACS credentials. Please note that the username must be in the format UMIACS\username, where username is replaced by your UMIACS username.

When: Saturday, March 24th 2018 from 8am-11:59pm

︗Introduction
Currently UMIACS provides two user authentication stores, our Linux/UNIX Kerberos5 realm and Windows Active Directory (PC). To simplify the user experience we will be consolidating authentication into a single new Active Directory domain (UMIACS).  At the end of the consolidation, you will be able to use a single password for all UMIACS services.
To prepare for this change, UMIACS staff need to migrate all UMIACS Windows accounts to a new domain. This migration starts by moving your account from our existing Windows Active Directory domain (PC\username) to a new one (UMIACS\username). After this migration is completed we will follow up with an announcement detailing the final steps of the password consolidation process.
No files or emails will be lost as part of this migration.​

︗Actions you need to take
Log off your Windows workstation (if you have one) prior to 8am on Saturday, March 24th, otherwise you will be forcibly logged out at this time.
︗Service impact during this Migration
Your password will NOT change.
Authentication to the Pulse Secure VPN will not be available during this migration window. Existing sessions will not be terminated, allowing you to continue using the VPN through the migration.  Two days prior to the migration, we will extend the default VPN session limit to 48 hours in order to minimize your disruption. If you require the VPN during this time please make sure you authenticate and maintain your connection before the outage window starts.
Windows workstations will be unavailable to log into during this migration window.
Exchange email access will be interrupted during this migration window.  Exchange email will be delivered however will not be accessible from phones, Outlook, or Outlook Web Access until after the migration has concluded.
︗After the migration has completed
We will post an announcement on https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu) when the migration has completed and will also send a follow-up email.
Your Windows account format will change from PC\username to UMIACS\username where you are required to specify a domain. You must use this username format going forward. Services that will require this new format:
Outlook Web Access for Exchange email users
Phone email setup for Exchange email users
Remote Desktop workstation access
Saved network drive(The prior text links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026635/windows-map-a-network-drive) credentials, which can be updated via Credential Manager(The prior text links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026814/windows-accessing-credential-manager)

The sidebar, labeled "My calendars," displays checked items such as "Liam Monahan," "Reminders," and "Tasks," along with a section titled "Other calendars." The interface's minimalistic design features a clean white background, emphasizing ease of navigation, with icons for creating events at the top left. In the upper right, the user’s UMD email address is visible, confirming the account type, while the overall layout is clear and user-friendly.

#### Image 2: Event Creation Window in Google Calendar
The second image presents the Google Calendar event creation window. At the top, the bold header reads "Add title," prompting users to input the event name. Below, the date—Thursday, April 4, 2019—is shown, and the specified time slots indicate the event lasts from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, with a note indicating the event does not repeat. On the left, users can add guests and select a location, with a highlighted button to "Add Google Meet video conferencing," emphasizing integration options. There is a presence indicator showing that "Matthew R. Baney" is marked as busy, with default visibility settings in place. The interface maintains a clean aesthetic with a distinct white background and blue accents, culminating in a blue "Save" button at the bottom right, guiding users to finalize their event details.
If this is a  moderated room, an email for approval will be sent to the moderator(s) at this point.  Your reservation is not valid until one of the moderators for the room approves.
If this is an  auto-accept room, your reservation is valid immediately.

To start, open Settings through your start menu by searching for it or clicking the gear icon.

The image depicts the Windows Settings interface on a computer. The top section of the window features a search bar labeled "Find a setting," allowing users to quickly locate specific settings. Below this, there is a title indicating "Windows Settings." 

The left side of the display lists multiple categories, with icons representing each setting, such as a globe for "Network & Internet," a person for "Accounts," and a pencil for "Personalization." The "System" option is highlighted in a prominent red box, indicating it is currently selected. 

Under the "System" category, related options like "Display, sound, notifications, power" are shown. Additional categories, such as "Devices," "Phone," "Ease of Access," and "Privacy," are laid out below, each accompanied by respective icons.

The overall color scheme is light, with a white background and colored icons, giving a modern, clean appearance typical of Windows interfaces. The design emphasizes accessibility and ease of navigation, helping users adjust their system settings efficiently.

Once you have opened it, click System.

The image displays the "Display" settings interface from the Windows operating system. The layout is simple and functional, with a predominantly light gray background. At the top, a search bar labeled "Find a setting" allows users to quickly search for options. Below this, the "System" category is highlighted in a bold red box, indicating users are currently within this section, specifically viewing "Display."

In the center, two rectangular boxes numbered "1" and "2" represent the connected displays. The first box is highlighted in red, suggesting it is the primary display, while the second is shown in gray. Below these boxes, there are two buttons labeled "Identify" and "Detect," facilitating the identification and detection of connected displays.

The bottom half contains a "Brightness and color" section with a slider for adjusting brightness. Below this, there is an option for "Night light," indicating it's turned on, with settings for the duration displayed underneath. The overall design promotes user accessibility and ease, characteristic of modern Windows interfaces, with a clean aesthetic and intuitive layout.

Click Display on the left bar if it is not already selected and scroll to the bottom of the page.

The image depicts the "Display" settings interface of the Windows operating system. It features a light gray background, creating a clean look conducive to usability. At the top, a search bar labeled "Find a setting" allows users to search directly for specific options. The title "Display" is located prominently, indicating the section users are currently viewing, within the broader "System" settings category.

Center stage are two rectangular boxes numbered "1" and "2," representing connected monitors, with the first box highlighted in red, signifying it as the primary display. Underneath these boxes are buttons labeled "Identify" and "Detect," facilitating interaction with multiple displays. The lower part of the window contains options related to configuring display settings, including different choices for multiple displays: "Duplicate these displays," "Extend these displays," "Show only on 1," and "Show only on 2." The option currently highlighted is "Extend these displays," presented in a red box, indicating an active selection. Overall, the interface is designed for intuitive navigation, with options clearly delineated and visually accessible.

By default, the displays are used in extended mode. If you wish to switch to mirror mode, select the Duplicate these displays option.

There are also 2 more options here then there normally are, Show only on 1 and Show only on 2.

Show only on 1 will only use the screen that you normally use for your computer, leaving the TV blank.
Show only on 2 will only use the TV as the screen, leaving the screen that you normally use blank.

︗Nexus/MC2

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The previous standalone cluster for MC2(The prior text links to https://cyber.umd.edu/about)'s compute nodes have folded into Nexus as of mid 2022.
The Nexus cluster already has a large pool of compute resources made possible through college-level funding for UMIACS and CSD faculty. Details on common nodes already in the cluster (Tron partition) can be found  here.
Please  contact staff with any questions or concerns.

︗Contents

1 Submission Nodes
2 Resources
3 QoS
4 Jobs
5 Storage


︗Submission Nodes
You can SSH to nexusmc2.umiacs.umd.edu to log in to a submission host.
If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:

nexusmc200.umiacs.umd.edu
nexusmc201.umiacs.umd.edu
︗Resources
The MC2 partition has nodes brought over from the previous standalone MC2 Slurm scheduler. The compute nodes are named twist##.

︗QoS
MC2 users have access to all of the  standard job QoSes in the MC2 partition using the mc2 account.
The additional jobs QoSes for the MC2 partition specifically are:

highmem: Allows for significantly increased memory to be allocated.
huge-long: Allows for longer jobs using higher overall resources.
Please note that the partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on the partition-specific nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use.

︗Jobs
You will need to specify --partition=mc2 and --account=mc2 to be able to submit jobs to the MC2 partition.

︗Java

From UMIACS
(Redirected from JavaVersions)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Java can be obtained in one of two flavors: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK). Unless you do programming in Java, JRE is usually sufficient for running programs and applets written in Java. JRE is also included in JDK so there is no need to install both.  There are two main flavors of Java that we have support for Oracle Java(The prior text links to http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/overview/index.html) and OpenJDK(The prior text links to http://openjdk.java.net/).

︗None
The version of Java running can be checked by running the following command on any RHEL/Ubuntu machine. Alternative JDK and JRE options can be found in /usr/lib/jvm. bash-4.2$ java -version
︗Windows
JRE is installed on all supported workstations by default and auto-updated to the latest version periodically. If for some reason your machine does not have Java, you may send a request to staff(The prior text links to mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu) to have JRE or JDK installed on your machine.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Apptainer contains the following information: 






︗Apptainer

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Apptainer(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org) is a container platform that doesn't elevate the privileges of a user running the container.  This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus) and doesn't provide administrative control to users on them.  While Docker(The prior text links to https://www.docker.com) is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.
Apptainer was previously branded as Singularity.  You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity, however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.

︗Contents

1 Overview
2 Nexus Containers

2.1 Bind Mounts
2.2 Shared Containers


3 Docker Workflow Example


︗Overview
You can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command.  If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please  contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on.

# apptainer --version
apptainer version 1.2.5-1.el8

Apptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/docker_and_oci.html).  To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.
If you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories.  We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like.

export WORKDIR=/scratch0/$USER
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${WORKDIR}/.cache
export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/.tmp
mkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR
mkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIR


We do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file (SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image.

Now you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command.  

Please note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag. Nvidia has a very specific driver and libraries that are required to run CUDA programs, so this is to ensure that all appropriate devices are created inside the container and that these libraries are made available in the container .

︗Nexus Containers
In our Nexus environment we have some example containers based on our pytorch_docker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker) project.  These can be found in /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch.
You can just run one of the example images by doing the following (you should have already allocated a interactive job with a GPU in Nexus).  It will use the default script(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker/-/blob/master/tensor.py) found at /srv/tensor.py within the image.

$ hostname && nvidia-smi -L

︗Bind Mounts
To get data into the container you need to pass some bind mounts(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/bind_paths_and_mounts.html).  Apptainer containers will not automatically mount data from the outside operating system other than your home directory.  Users need to manually bind mounts for other file paths.
--bind /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>/<PROJECTNAME>:/mnt
In this example, we will exec an interactive session with GPUs and binding our Nexus scratch directory which allows us to specify the command we want to run inside the container.

apptainer exec --nv --bind /fs/nexus-scratch/username:/fs/nexus-scratch/username /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch/pytorch_1.13.0+cu117.sif bash

You can now write/run your own pytorch python code interactively within the container or just make a python script that you can call directly from the apptainer exec command for batch processing.


︗Shared Containers
Portable images called Singularity Image Format or .sif files can be copied and shared.  Nexus maintains some shared containers in /fs/nexus-containers.  These are arranged by the application(s) that are installed.

︗Docker Workflow Example
We have a pytorch_docker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker) example workflow using our GitLab as a Docker registry.  You can clone the repository and further customize this to your needs. The workflow is:

Run Docker on a laptop or personal desktop on to create the image, or use Podman on a UMIACS-supported system.
Tag the image and and push it to your repository (this can be any docker registry)
Pull the image down onto one of our workstations/clusters and run it with your data.

1 Free malware/virus removal tools
2 Online vs Offline Scanners

2.1 Online Scanners
2.2 Offline/Bootable Scanners


3 UMIACS-Supported Machines

3.1 How to a run manual F-Secure Scan




︗None
For non-UMIACS supported systems, there are several virus and malware protection and removal tools available. This page lists and describes some of them. 
Note: these are just a few of the many available anti-virus removal tools. One can always search the internet for a well-reputed anti-virus program and use that instead.

︗Online vs Offline Scanners
There are two types of malware/virus removal tools, online and offline. The main difference between the two is that offline scans work outside of your computer's operating system. This can provide an alternate means for detecting and mitigating threats that may use various tactics to hide from your installed antivirus. On the other hand, online scanners can detect most problems while also being easier to use. Most online scanners have better interfaces than their offline counterparts, and they are usually easier to set up and run. Thus, the best way to remove malware or a virus would be to first try an online scanner and see if the issue still persists. If the online scanner did not fix the problem, then you should try an offline scanner. Below are some links to various online and offline scanners.

︗Online Scanners
F-Secure Online Scan(The prior text links to https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/free-tools/online-scanner)
The online scanner helps to get rid of viruses and spyware that may cause problems on your PC.
Malwarebytes(The prior text links to https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/)
This free version is limited, but can also perform malware and virus scans.
︗None
Microsoft Defender Offline(The prior text links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-protect-my-pc-with-microsoft-defender-offline-9306d528-64bf-4668-5b80-ff533f183d6c)
This offline scan only works with machines using Windows 10 or 11.
︗UMIACS-Supported Machines
All UMIACS-supported machines have F-Secure Client Security installed. Follow the steps below to run a manual scan using F-Secure on a UMIACS-supported machine.

︗How to a run manual F-Secure Scan

 Open F-Secure Client Security by searching it in the search bar.
The provided image depicts the Windows search interface with the focus on "F-Secure Client Security," an application icon featuring a stylized shield in black and white. The search results list highlights "F-Secure Client Security - App" at the top, suggesting it's the most relevant result. Below this, there are several related options, including “Open,” “Run as administrator,” “Open file location,” “Pin to Start,” “Pin to taskbar,” and “Uninstall.”

The interface is characterized by a clean layout typical of Windows, showcasing a white background with black text. The application’s icon is prominently displayed, which helps users quickly identify it. To the left, there are several other search results beginning with variations of "F-Secure," indicating that it includes various tools and support options related to the F-Secure software suite.

Malware scan: Searches common places where malware can be found. This makes it faster, but it may miss some hidden malware.
Full computer Scan: Scans all internal/external hard drives for malware. This makes it more thorough than the malware scan, but it can take a long time to complete.
 After choosing an option, another screen should pop up that shows the progress of the scan. 
 The image showcases the scanning interface of the F-Secure Client Security application. It features a minimalist design with a light gray background and a large circular progress indicator at the center. The indicator is divided into two segments: a green circle encircles a smaller white circle, suggesting an ongoing scan. Above the progress indicator, the word "Scanning" is prominently displayed in blue, signifying the status of the operation.

To the left and right of the central circle, two sections indicate the number of detected items: "System" and "Memory," both displaying "0 item(s)," which implies no threats found in these areas. 

At the bottom of the screen, there’s a reassuring message: "Nothing harmful has been found," reinforcing a sense of security for the user. In the bottom right corner, a blue "Stop" button is visible, allowing users to cancel the scan if needed. Overall, the interface conveys efficiency and clarity, making it user-friendly and accessible for individuals performing a malware scan.
 Once the scan is complete, it will provide a report stating whether any malware was found. If if did find malware, then it will show you the number of files it removed. You can click View scanning report to see more details about specific files.
 The image displays the final screen of the F-Secure Client Security application after a malware scan has been completed. The interface features a primarily white background that enhances clarity. At the center, there is a large green circular check mark, indicating a successful scan with the message "Scanning complete" prominently displayed in blue above it. 

Beneath the check mark, there is reassuring text stating "No harmful items found," conveying a positive outcome of the scan. This reassurance is essential for users concerned about their system's security. Below this, a link reads "View scanning report," providing users with the option to review more detailed information about the scan if desired. On the bottom right, a blue button labeled "Close" allows users to exit the scan screen. 

Overall, the image conveys a sense of relief and satisfaction, signifying that the scan has identified no threats, enhancing user confidence in the application's effectiveness. The clean and user-friendly design encourages straightforward navigation.
 Click the Close button to close the scan window and complete the scan.

︗Orders

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The following pages outline the procedures and best practices for creating and requesting orders.

︗Contents

1 Requesting UMIACS Orders

1.1 Important Considerations
1.2 Option 1: Using the web form
1.3 Option 2: Sending email to staff directly
1.4 Option 3: Submitting order within Jira yourself


2 When Staff Receives the Order


︗Requesting UMIACS Orders
Before proceeding: If the KFS account you plan on charging is owned by the Computer Science Department, please instead consult their FAQ(The prior text links to https://helpdesk.cs.umd.edu/faq/iribe/equipment-peripherals) for ordering the equipment you want.

︗Important Considerations
Verbosity is always preferred to lack of critical details.
Ticket descriptions should contain a list of specific items being ordered (provide direct links) unless you're attaching an official quote. Please do not include wishlists or links to carts.
If priority shipping is required, please include that in the subject of the email.
︗Option 1: Using the web form
Fill out the form here(The prior text links to https://businessoffice.umiacs.umd.edu/form/order) and click Submit. This will automatically generate a ticket for staff to action on.
Please note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN(The prior text links to https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/4010), or the  UMIACS VPN to access this form.

︗Option 2: Sending email to staff directly
We offer a simple Form(The prior text links to /umiacs/images/2/24/Ordering_Form.pdf) that you can fill out and send to orders@umiacs.umd.edu along with any applicable quote(s).  Please make sure that you CC the PI or include the email confirmation for any accounts that require committee approval (e.g., RQS).
Otherwise, please follow these instructions.

Please CC the PI for the KFS(The prior text links to https://kualifinancial.umd.edu/) account you want to charge.
In the body of your email:
Specify the KFS account to charge.
Specify the items using links or attached quotes and specify the amount of each item. Please do not use wishlists or carts.
Quotes must include any applicable shipping costs.
If ordering from numerous vendors:
Send one email per vendor. Otherwise, UMIACS staff will separate your request into different emails/Jira tickets after the fact.
Specify if you want priority shipping per vendor. If no shipping speed is selected, the lowest cost shipping that still provides tracking will be used.
Specify the purpose of the purchase (brief description). If on sponsored funds such as federal grants, the description should also provide how the purchase relates to the purpose of the project.
︗None
Log into the Jira web interface at https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/portals(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/portals) and select the UMIACS Orders option.
You will be presented with the default ordering screen. Here is a very fictitious example:
Please note that Summary, Reporter, Account and PI are mandatory fields.
The image depicts a computer screen showcasing a web-based order submission form for UMIACS (University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies) requests. At the top of the form, there's a header labeled "UMIACS Request Tracker / UMIACS Orders," with a dollar sign icon to signify financial transactions.

The form fields are organized neatly, including dropdowns and text boxes. The first field, titled "Raise this request on behalf of," includes an email address field set to "staff@umiacs.umd.edu." Below that is the "Summary" field containing the text "Rum Ham Emporium | Shan Sampler for Person/Lab," indicating a specific item being ordered.

The "Description" section has text stating "Order 1x Shan Sampler Quote Attached," suggesting additional details about the order. There is also an optional field for the Principal Investigator (PI), which is filled with the username "fmccall," and another optional field labeled "Account," filled with "UMIACS DRIF."

At the bottom of the form, there's an "Attachment" section where a document entitled "Shan_sampler_quote.pdf" is displayed, confirming that a quote is included. Two buttons, "Create" and "Cancel," are present for submitting or discarding the order request. The overall layout is clean and functional, reinforced by a user-friendly interface designed for straightforward order processing.

Requester
If the order is being requested by CBCB, IMD, MC2, QuICS, or RQS, prepend the summary with [CBCB], [IMD], [MC2], [QuICS], or [RQS] respectively.
Summary
This should be of the format "Vendor | Brief Description".
If the order must be placed today, this will instead be "PRIORITY TODAY | Vendor | Brief Description".
Account
This should be the account (KFS) to be charged. Please be as specific as possible. Account number is preferred, but if you don't know it, a specific description is OK (e.g., don't say "DRIF" since there are multiple DRIF accounts, instead say "UMIACS DRIF", or "CBCB DRIF", etc.)
In the event that a single order has multiple accounts, list them all and specify which items are being charged to what accounts (or what percent of an item is being charged to an account) in the description.
PI
A PI (Principal Adviser) who has approved the purchase on the KFS account.
In some cases, multiple PIs can charge to a single KFS account.
Description
Provide a description of what you want to buy or provide it in a comment before you submit your order.
When possible, provide a link to the item to be purchased.
When purchasing through Amazon or a site that provides fulfillment for third party vendors, please state the specific vendor that is providing the item and at what price. This is to prevent errors caused by ordering from a different vendor when the site auto-updates.
It's good to be polite with your description. ex - "Hi, please purchase $requestedItems. Here are the links/relevant information: $relevantInformation. Thanks!"
︗When Staff Receives the Order
As long as the PI is CC'd and all needed information is present, we will go ahead and process the order.
You will receive an email to pick up the order(s) when it arrives.
If you are sending someone other than yourself, the PI, or someone already CC'd on the ORDERS ticket to pickup the items: Please let us know who that person is prior to having them arrive for pickup. Otherwise, we may attempt to contact you at time of pickup to verify their identity/association with the order.

︗Publishing Data

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
UMIACS offers efficient and secure methods for publishing your data, including reports, papers, and more. This page offers best practices and guidelines for publishing your information using our resources. It also offers instructions for storing data that is within your allotted quota.

︗Contents

1 Best Practices
2 LabGroups
3 OBJ Usage

3.1 Uploading files/data
3.2 Publishing Websites




︗Best Practices
When publishing anything, the following items are important to consider:

Be sure that any/all data is published via a faculty member's account or a Labgroup (see below), not a student's (this is especially important when the data in question is meant to be permanent). This will reduce the chance of any broken links once the student leaves and their account is archived.
OBJ (see below) should be used whenever data or websites are published.
Make sure UMIACS is credited on any papers that contain UMIACS URLs.
︗LabGroups
LabGroups allow for multiple users to upload data to a central shared location. This is especially useful if multiple people are contributing to a single project. To learn more about LabGroups, visit The OBJ help page(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help) or OBJ for more information. 

︗OBJ Usage
The use of the  UMIACS Object Storage (otherwise known as OBJ) is the preferred method of publishing websites, data, and related info. Below are some short guides to publish websites and/or data on OBJ.

︗None
After logging in to OBJ(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/), select "Add Bucket".
A "bucket" is essentially a folder that stores files.
Upload any datasets or other files that contain the data you wish to publish.
For publishing websites, continue to the "Publishing Websites" section. For datasets and the like continue on.
In order to make any files publicly available, click the settings cog on the right side of the file, scroll down, and click "Make Key Public"
Note that this makes this specific file available to anyone with the link. If you only wish to grant temporary access or access to a specific user, you may want to consider creating a timed download link or modifying the Access Control List at the bottom of the page. More information can be found on the OBJ help page(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help)
︗Publishing Websites
Generally, for publishing websites, you'll want to upload all your website files under one bucket. UMIACS recommends that you include an index.html file as well as a error file to be shown in case of a broken link (404). Once all these files are uploaded:

In the bucket, click "bucket settings" at the top of the window.
Under the "Website Hosting" section, put the name of your index file (usually just index.html) and the name of your 404 page.
Click "Submit".
Keep in mind that this will expose all data in your bucket. We recommend keeping any sensitive/access controlled data in a separate bucket.
The website will be made public and can be reached using the link at the right side. In order to make the website non-public, simply click "Remove Website Configuration" and then "Make Private" in the above section.


In addition to the above, there are more ways to add data to OBJ which can prove useful, especially if working with a lot of files. See The OBJ help page(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help) for more information.

3.2 HTTPS


4 Make GitLab projects public


︗GitLab Offsite Collaborators
Any UMIACS user can now create an unlimited number of offsite
collaborator accounts for our Security Groups, GitLab and Object Store.  These accounts can not create
repositories or groups, but may be given access to your repositories or
groups.  You can find this utility in our Requests(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests) application under UMIACS Collaborators(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts).

︗User Documentation
GitLab provides user documentation that can be accessed at https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help)
Some of the most useful sections include:

Permissions and user roles - https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/permissions.md(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/permissions.md)
GitLab markdown for wikis and READMEs - https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/markdown.md(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/markdown.md)
︗Repository URLs
Users can clone git repos over either SSH or HTTPS.  We recommend using SSH because it is more convenient for most users.  The blue "Clone" button in the upper-right corner of your GitLab project page will contain the clone URL for whichever authentication method you prefer.

︗SSH
To use SSH, add an SSH key to your GitLab account. Instructions to do so can be found here(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/ssh.md). Once you have the SSH key added, you can authenticate without having to enter any credentials from the machine and account for which you created the SSH key (if your key is not password-protected).

︗HTTPS
The HTTPS URL can be used as well, but you will need to setup Personal Access Tokens in order to connect. Instructions to create one can be found here(The prior text links to https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html). Once you have a token, you can use that as your password when prompted. You will have to re-enter your credentials for GitLab every single time that you attempt to commit to, push to, pull from, or otherwise access the remote repository.

︗Make GitLab projects public
Making projects public grants access to everyone. Projects can only made public by the owner. To make your projects on GitLab public, follow the steps below:
1. Go to your project page.
2. Click on Settings.
3. Scroll down to Project Visibility. Choose Public from the drop-down menu.
4. Scroll down and click on Save Changes
5. Scroll down to Repository under Project Visibility and select Everyone with access from the drop-down menu.
6. Click on Save Changes.
Now your project has become public with its repository accessible by anyone.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Compute/DataLocality contains the following information: 






︗Compute/DataLocality

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
This page covers some best practices related to data processing on UMIACS Compute resources.

︗Contents

1 Data Locality

1.1 General Workflow
1.2 Why this matters


2 Data Storage
3 Identifying Local Disk Space


︗Data Locality
It is recommended to store data that is actively being worked on as close to the processing source as possible.  In the context of a cluster job, the data being processed, as well as any generated results, should be stored on a disk physically installed in the compute node itself.  We'll cover how to identify local disk space later on this page.

︗General Workflow
The following is a suggested workflow for a computational job:

Copy the data to be processed to the local compute node.
Process the data, storing results on local disk space.
Once processing is finished, transfer results to permanent storage location. (i.e. a network file share)
Clean up data and results from compute node local disk space.
︗Why this matters
Similar to how too many processes on a single machine can slow it down, too many users accessing a network file server can impact performance.  This issue is further compounded in the context of cluster jobs, as a single user can generate hundreds if not thousands of jobs all trying to access the same network fileserver.  By utilizing the local disks on the compute nodes, you effectively distribute the data access load and reduce the load on the central fileserver.
Following these best practices isn't just about being a good neighbor however, they will also improve the performance of your jobs.


To further illustrate this issue, consider a service like Netflix.  While Netflix invests heavily in their data storage and supporting network, if they allowed their customers to access it directly it would quickly reach capacity resulting in performance degradation for all users.  In order to accommodate this Netflix distributes it's data into various caching tiers, which are much closer to the end user.  This distribution evens the load across multiple different devices, increasing the performance and availability for all users.

While UMIACS obviously does not operate at the same scale as Netflix, the same issues are still present within the compute infrastructure.  Processing data that resides on local disk space reduces the load on the central file server and improves the performance of the process.


︗Data Storage
When possible, it is recommended that data be stored in an archive file.
Utilizing archive files provide the following benefits:

Faster data transfers
Reduced data size
Easier data management.
Practically every filesystem in existence has limitations in it's ability to handle large numbers of small files.  By grouping large collections of small files into a single archive file we reduce the impact of this limitation, as well as improve the efficiency of data storage when combined with techniques such as compression.  Another advantage manifests when transferring data over the network.  In order to transfer a file a connection to the remote location has to be established and closed for each file, which can add significant overhead when dealing with large numbers of files.  When the files are collected into a single archive file we reduce the number of connections that are created and destroyed, and focus more on streaming data.  
Common utilities for creating archive files are tar and zip.


︗Identifying Local Disk Space
Local disk storage at UMIACS typically conforms to the following guidelines:

Directory name starts with /scratch
Almost every UMIACS supported machine has a /scratch0
Machines with multiple local disks will have multiple /scratchX directories, where X is a number that increases with the number of disks.
# Output shortened for brevity.
-bash-4.2$ lsblk 
NAME               MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda                  8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
└─sda2               8:2    0 930.5G  0 part 
  ├─vol00-scratch0 253:3    0   838G  0 lvm  /scratch0
sdb                  8:16   0   477G  0 disk 
└─sdb1               8:17   0   477G  0 part /scratch1
sdc                  8:32   0 953.9G  0 disk 
└─sdc1-scratch2    253:2    0 953.9G  0 lvm  /scratch2

As shown above, common utilities such as lsblk can be used to identify the specific configuration on a given node.



Please provide the images you'd like described, and I'll generate detailed textual descriptions for each of them.

Local data storage is considered transitory and as such is not backed up.  It is not intended for long-term storage of critical/sensitive data.

If you have any questions about the available local disk storage on a given cluster please refer to the documentation specific for that cluster, or contact  the UMIACS Help Desk.

Secure Copy (or SCP(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) is a way of copying data between two computers using SSH.

︗Using SCP
SCP (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to securely copy files and directories between two locations. The following commands work under Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and macOS. 
This command, when run from a terminal, will copy the file "source_file0.txt" from the local machine to the home directory of nexusstaff00 and give it the name "target_file0.txt".

[jayid07@dedsec ~]$ scp source_file.txt jayid07@nexusstaff00:target_file.txt

This command, when run from a terminal, will copy the file "source_file1.txt" from the user's NFS homedirectory on nexustaff00 into the current local directory and give it the name "target_file1.txt".

[jayid07@dedsec ~]$ scp jayid07@nexusstaff00.umiacs.umd.edu:source_file1.txt target_file1.txt

Note how the syntax of scp is very similar to that of the UNIX command cp with the addition of a hostname and username.
For UMIACS supported Windows hosts, WinSCP (available for download here(The prior text links to http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)) is already installed.

︗Project Directories
UMIACS labs distribute shared data to workgroups onsite and outside UMIACS using a wide variety of protocols including FTP, SFTP, SCP, NFS, and SMB.
On-site clients can access project directories through the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols. Supported UNIX workstations map project directories to 

   /fs/

Windows workstations map project directories as 

   \\*.umiacs.umd.edu\

As an example, for directories on the Isilon, the path would be \\data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu\. 
Project data storage may not be shared by default with every host.  Please send mail to  staff to configure a new share.
Clients can also access data using authenticated File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), and Secure Copy (SCP) through UMIACS file servers.

︗Usage Guidelines
Project Directories using Network attached Storage (NAS) are tuned for your workgroup's requirements and preferences.
Please avoid storing personal data in project storage allocations. Separating project data from personal data will simplify administration and data management for both researchers and staff.

2.2 Shutting Down




︗ATL 3100A
This conference room comes equipped with a touch panel that can be used to control the video and audio source(s) and level(s) being used to project to the displays in the room. There is a Room PC ("PC Main"), a Solstice Pod ("Solstice"), and an HDMI cable to use a laptop or external device ("Laptop").
There is also an "Audio Override" output device that you can project any of the input sources to. This decouples the source audio from the source video so that you can send audio from one source to the audio output while maintaining video from a difference source. The primary use of this is to be able to prevent echoing and have teleconferencing participants be able to hear the room audience when using both a laptop and the room PC to present. With both devices in the same teleconference session, leave "Laptop" as the source video and switch the audio override to "PC Main" to display what is on the laptop but use the microphones spread throughout the room to hear the audience.
The image depicts a close-up view of a touch panel control interface for an audio-visual (A/V) system, prominently featuring a Crestron brand interface. The panel is primarily a light gray background with various icons and labels, structured for easy navigation. At the top left, there is a red button labeled "Shutdown A/V System," which is likely used to power down the equipment. Adjacent to it, there is a button for “Device Control,” suggesting additional functionalities for managing connected devices.

The central section of the panel displays options for selecting input and output devices. It features icons for a "Laptop Projector" and "Laptop Monitor," indicating video output options. Below them, a circular blue button marked "Audio Override" is highlighted, indicating that users can select audio sources independently from video sources. The lower section includes options for video sources, labeled "PC Main," "Solstice," "Blank," and "Laptop," allowing users to choose between different input methods. Each element is clear and precise, with straightforward instructions displayed at the bottom: "First Select a Source To Be Routed Below, then the Destination." The overall design is user-friendly, aimed at facilitating seamless A/V management during presentations or meetings.

︗Sources

1 Introduction
2 Usage
3 Window Management
4 Copy Mode
5 Prefix Key


︗Introduction
tmux is a terminal multiplexer(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer) for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals, allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible.

︗Usage
To invoke a new tmux session, simply use the following command in a terminal:

# tmux new

You can also name the session using the -s flag. In this example, the session is named mysession:

# tmux new -s mysession

If you need to end your SSH session but want your processes to keep running, you can detach the tmux session by using:

# Ctrl-b + d

Then exit as normal.
If you have multiple tmux sessions you can detach and reattach them at any time. To list the current tmux sessions running, use:

# tmux ls

The output will be similar to this:

# user@machine:~$ tmux ls
# mysession: 1 windows (created Thu Oct 22 10:11:44 2020)
# session2: 1 windows (created Thu Oct 22 10:11:52 2020)
# session3: 1 windows (created Thu Oct 22 10:11:58 2020)

To reconnect to a specific tmux session you may use the attach command:

# user@machine:~$ tmux attach -t mysession

︗Window Management
In tmux, windows show up at the bottom of your session with a name and a sort number.
You can create a new window in your session by using:

# Ctrl-b c

You can navigate to the next window using:

# Ctrl-b n

You can navigate to the previous window using:

# Ctrl-b p

You can rename the current window using:

# Ctrl-b ,

You can close the current window using:

# Ctrl-b &

︗Copy Mode
In order to navigate around a page in tmux, You must first enter Copy Mode and then you can start navigating:  
To enter Copy Mode use:

# Ctrl-b [

Once in Copy Mode, you can navigate normally using the arrow keys as well as other functions.
To go to the top of the page type:

# g

To go to the bottom of the page type:

# G



︗Prefix Key
You can change the prefix keystrok from <ctrl>-b to <ctrl>-a for example by adding the following to your ~/.tmux.conf.

# remap prefix from 'C-b' to 'C-a'
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

︗Overview
UMIACS has rolled out multi-factor authentication requirements when using SSH to connect to our public-facing hosts to provide better account and data security. Public-facing hosts are hosts that are reachable via the Internet (e.g. via ping(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility))) without first establishing a connection to our VPN. If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border).
SSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and  public key authentication. Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically. Other hardware tokens such as a YubiKey(The prior text links to https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) or Duo's own hardware token(The prior text links to https://guide.duo.com/tokens) will still work.

︗Example
The initial command or session setup for connecting to a host with multi-factor authentication enabled over SSH is the same as one that does not have it enabled. Our example for connecting to a host over SSH can be found  here. In the below example, we are also SSH-ing to a Nexus node e.g. ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
Once you enter the command (if using a native terminal) or start the session (PuTTY or other terminal emulators), you will be presented with the following prompt:

Password:

Enter your UMIACS password here (the same as if you were using interactive password authentication to connect to an internal host). After correctly entering your password, you will be taken to the following prompt. Please note: The options shown here will vary depending on what/how many devices you have registered with our Duo instance. In this example, we have a mobile phone that has the Duo app installed, a tablet (iPad) that has the Duo app installed, a Duo hardware token, and a YubiKey all registered against our UMIACS Duo instance.

Password:
Duo two-factor login for username

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234
 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4):

(if you have a registered phone, the last 4 digits shown will be replaced with the last 4 digits of the phone number you specifically have registered)
The numbered options here correspond to different methods that Duo can take to authenticate you, and are more or less identical to the options that would be presented to you via a GUI if you were attempting to sign into another of our multi-factor authentication secured services, such as our Directory application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/auth/login). You can also enter the passcode 

︗Duo Push to ___
This will send a push notification to the Duo app on whichever device you chose for you to accept to proceed.

Passcode or option (1-4): 1

Pushed a login request to your device...

︗Phone call to XXX-XXX-XXXX

(After answering) 

Answered. Press any key on your phone to log in.
︗SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-XXXX
This will send a one time passcode to your registered phone via SMS and then redisplay the prompt. Type the passcode received at the new prompt (which will show the first number of the passcode sent as a hint) to proceed.

Passcode or option (1-4): 4

New SMS passcodes sent.

Duo two-factor login for username

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234

 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234 (next code starts with: 1)

Passcode or option (1-4): 1234567

︗Enter passcode or tap YubiKey
In addition, you can also enter the code shown in your Duo app for UMIACS, the code shown on a registered hardware token, or tap your YubiKey to emit a code:

︗Code shown in Duo app or hardware token
The image depicts a rectangular white card labeled "DUO-PROTECTED" at the top, with the acronym "UMIACS" printed in a bold font beneath it. The primary feature of the card is a six-digit numerical code: "672 239," prominently displayed in large black digits, centered on the card. The overall design is simple and straightforward, emphasizing the importance of the numerical code for authentication purposes. The card's background is plain, which contrasts with the dark text, making the information easy to read. The inclusion of the term "DUO-PROTECTED" suggests that the card is used for multi-factor authentication via the Duo Security platform, indicating that it plays a role in securing access to UMIACS systems.
(if in the Duo app)

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4): 672239

The image shows a Duo security token, a small handheld device primarily used for multi-factor authentication. The token has a sleek, oval shape and is largely black. Prominently displayed on the front is the Duo logo in a bold, white font with a circular green button situated above a digital display. The digital screen shows a six-digit numerical code: "123456," indicating it is currently generating a verification code for use in a two-factor authentication process. The device has a silver keychain loop, allowing it to be easily attached to a keyring or bag, emphasizing its portability. The overall design is simple yet functional, focusing on providing security while ensuring ease of use for individuals accessing secure systems. The combination of the bright green button and the clear digital display contrasts well against the dark casing, allowing for quick readability and user interaction. This device plays a crucial role in enhancing security by generating temporary codes that users must enter when logging into systems that require multi-factor authentication.
(if using a hardware token)

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4): 123456

︗YubiKey tap
Simply tap the sensor on your YubiKey plugged into the device you are using to SSH to have it emit a string of characters and automatically hit Enter.

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234
 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4): kffuastenhldrhfhadafdarivuntddugrvjvllddjjuget

︗Wrapping up
After finishing your method of choice for using Duo to multi-factor authenticate, you will be logged in and can operate as normal.

Success. Logging you in...
Last login: Wed Feb 17 12:00:00 2021 from ...
[username@nexusgroup00 ~]$

Subsequent SSH attempts from the window you have already connected via will not require multi-factor authentication, even if the host you are trying to SSH to is another public-facing host. This is because at this point the point of origin for the network traffic behind the connection attempt is coming from within the UMIACS border, rather than the rest of the Internet.

[username@nexusgroup00 ~]$ ssh nexusgroup01.umiacs.umd.edu
username@nexusgroup01.umiacs.umd.edu's password:
Last login: Wed Feb 17 11:59:00 2021 from ...
[username@nexusgroup01 ~]$

︗Considerations
Since there is now an additional step to log in to our public-facing hosts if not using our VPN, we would recommend first establishing a connection over our VPN if you anticipate needing to SSH to several different hosts or need to open several different terminal windows concurrently. As mentioned previously, you do not need an additional multi-factor authentication step when using SSH if you first connect to our VPN since it is already secured by multi-factor authentication.
An alternative would be to use a terminal multiplexer(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer) such as Screen or Tmux to minimize the number of times you need to multi-factor authenticate. Terminal multiplexers allow you to start several different processes out of one terminal display, and also detach from and later reattach to each of the processes.

Tensorflow(The prior text links to https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a Python deep learning package from Google.  The easiest way to use install it is to build a  Python virtualenv with it in it.
First load GPU modules to allow access to accelerated GPGPU training. You can find the list of Tensorflow versions and their corresponding Python/CUDA/cuDNN requirements here. [1](The prior text links to https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu) These modules are appropriate for tensorflow-2.16.1, which is the latest tensorflow release as of April 29, 2024.

module add Python3/3.9.16 cuda/12.4.1 cudnn/v8.9.7
Next you will want to create a virtualenv and source into it. Note that depending on the version of Tensorflow you need, you may also need to load a module for a more recent version of Python3.

$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $

Then ensure you have a recent copy of pip in your virtualenv.

(env) $ pip install --upgrade pip

Then install the Tensorflow wheel through pip.

(env) $ pip install --upgrade tensorflow

Finally, start up a python shell (or install ipython through pip) and import Tensorflow.

(env)[username@hostname:/scratch0/username ] $ python
Python 3.9.16 (main, Feb 28 2023, 09:58:09)

You can then try a more rigorous test by running the following example. Note that you may need to export XLA_FLAGS in your shell: export XLA_FLAGS=--xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=/opt/common/cuda/cuda-x.x.x

import tensorflow as tf
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist

(x_train, y_train),(x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),
  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

To use this install after you close the shell you did this install in, you will need to both add the correct CUDA/cuDNN modules, export the XLA_FLAGS variable (if needed), and activate the virtualenv by the source command.  This includes any time you are submitting to SLURM.

︗Unix groups

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
UNIX groups are useful for sharing file and directory permissions with other users in the UMIACS system. Each UMIACS account is by default a member of its own group, defined by that username. An account can be made member to any number of additional groups.

︗Contents

1 Creating Groups & Adding Users
2 Applying the Group
3 Verifying and Changing Group Permissions
4 Deleting Groups


︗None
A user may create up to 5 UNIX groups via the Directory tool(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/groups/).

Click Create UNIX Group on the Groups page(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/groups/)
Enter in the group name and a brief description of what the organization of users in the group is for, then click create group.
Click on the link of the newly created group, add a valid UMIACS user into the available text box, click add user. NOTE: The user creating the group is not added to that group by default, and must be explicitly added after creation.
︗Applying the Group
In order to apply the group to a file or directory to which you want to grant all members some set of permissions use the command
chgrp group-name file-name
This will grant the specified group ownership of the file, at the level of access that the previous group possessed.

︗Verifying and Changing Group Permissions
To see the permissions that the group has for a specific file/directory use  ls -l  and the group permissions will be the 5,6,7th characters of the permissions listing.
To change the permissions of the group on that file/directory, if you own the group, use
chmod g+r/w/x file-name 
︗Deleting Groups
Deleting groups will be managed by UMIACS staff. If you would like to delete a group, please submit a ticket through JIRA.

The image showcases a series of three icons representing the Ivanti Secure Access Client in different states: Disconnected, Connected, and Suspending. Each icon features a white key symbol, which signifies security and access, set against differently colored backgrounds. 

1. **Disconnected Icon:** On the left, the icon is set against a gradient of dark gray, transitioning to a medium gray. The key is centered and simple, implying that the service is currently inactive.

2. **Connected Icon:** The middle icon displays a vibrant red background, symbolizing active connectivity. The key maintains its white color and central placement. This color choice conveys alertness and active engagement with the secure access client.

3. **Suspending Icon:** The rightmost icon features a gradient background that transitions from orange to yellow, suggesting a state of temporary inaccessibility or waiting. The white key remains prominent, ensuring the message of security is clear even in this suspended state.

The overall design is minimalist yet effective, using color transitions to communicate different states while maintaining clarity and visual integrity. The icons collectively represent the functionality and status of the Ivanti Secure Access Client in a user-friendly manner. [Ivanti] Ivanti Secure Access Menubar system tray icon
Users have an option to switch between the Classic UI and New-UX to maintain user experience per individual preference.
The image displays the interface of the "Ivanti Secure Access Client." The layout appears modern and minimalistic, primarily featuring a light gray background that sets a soft tone for the display. On the left side, there is a vertical menu bar in a darker gray, offering eight options. The top option is labeled "UI Mode," with a dropdown that includes "Admin Setting" and "New UX" highlighted in a bright blue font, signifying the selected mode.

The main area showcases the title "Ivanti Secure Access Client" prominently at the top. Beneath it, there's a circular icon representing network connectivity, with the text "No Active Connections" clearly visible, indicating the current status of the VPN connection. Below this, two horizontal placeholders or tabs are visible, along with a plus sign icon, suggesting the option to add connections or settings. The overall design emphasizes clarity and user-friendliness, aligning with contemporary software aesthetics focused on secure access solutions. The interface appears intuitive, reflecting Ivanti's commitment to enhancing user experience in network management. [Ivanti] New-UX mode

︗Contents

1 Overview
2 Example

2.1 Duo Push to ___
2.2 Phone call to XXX-XXX-XXXX
2.3 SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-XXXX
2.4 Enter passcode or tap YubiKey

2.4.1 Code shown in Duo app or hardware token
2.4.2 YubiKey tap




3 Wrapping up
4 Considerations


︗Overview
UMIACS has rolled out multi-factor authentication requirements when using SSH to connect to our public-facing hosts to provide better account and data security. Public-facing hosts are hosts that are reachable via the Internet (e.g. via ping(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility))) without first establishing a connection to our VPN. If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border).
SSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and  public key authentication. Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically. Other hardware tokens such as a YubiKey(The prior text links to https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) or Duo's own hardware token(The prior text links to https://guide.duo.com/tokens) will still work.

︗Example
The initial command or session setup for connecting to a host with multi-factor authentication enabled over SSH is the same as one that does not have it enabled. Our example for connecting to a host over SSH can be found  here. In the below example, we are also SSH-ing to a Nexus node e.g. ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
Once you enter the command (if using a native terminal) or start the session (PuTTY or other terminal emulators), you will be presented with the following prompt:

Password:

Enter your UMIACS password here (the same as if you were using interactive password authentication to connect to an internal host). After correctly entering your password, you will be taken to the following prompt. Please note: The options shown here will vary depending on what/how many devices you have registered with our Duo instance. In this example, we have a mobile phone that has the Duo app installed, a tablet (iPad) that has the Duo app installed, a Duo hardware token, and a YubiKey all registered against our UMIACS Duo instance.

Password:
Duo two-factor login for username

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234
 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4):

(if you have a registered phone, the last 4 digits shown will be replaced with the last 4 digits of the phone number you specifically have registered)
The numbered options here correspond to different methods that Duo can take to authenticate you, and are more or less identical to the options that would be presented to you via a GUI if you were attempting to sign into another of our multi-factor authentication secured services, such as our Directory application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/auth/login). You can also enter the passcode 

︗Duo Push to ___
This will send a push notification to the Duo app on whichever device you chose for you to accept to proceed.

Passcode or option (1-4): 1

Pushed a login request to your device...

︗Phone call to XXX-XXX-XXXX
This will call your registered phone and ask you to press any key on your phone to proceed.

Passcode or option (1-4): 3

Calling your phone...
Dialing XXX-XXX-1234...

(After answering) 

Answered. Press any key on your phone to log in.
︗SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-XXXX
This will send a one time passcode to your registered phone via SMS and then redisplay the prompt. Type the passcode received at the new prompt (which will show the first number of the passcode sent as a hint) to proceed.

Passcode or option (1-4): 4

New SMS passcodes sent.

Duo two-factor login for username

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234
 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234 (next code starts with: 1)

Passcode or option (1-4): 1234567

︗Enter passcode or tap YubiKey
In addition, you can also enter the code shown in your Duo app for UMIACS, the code shown on a registered hardware token, or tap your YubiKey to emit a code:

︗Code shown in Duo app or hardware token
The image displays a rectangular, white card labeled "DUO-PROTECTED" at the top, indicating an association with UMIACS (University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies). The UMIACS logo is positioned on the left side, prominently featuring the organization's name in a bold, modern font. Below this label, the text "UMIACS" is displayed clearly. The central focus of the card is a six-digit code, "672 239," rendered in a large, bold, black font for easy readability. The card has a clean, minimalist design, devoid of additional graphics or colors beyond the white background and black text. This imagery conveys the essence of security and access control, emphasizing the importance of multi-factor authentication within the UMIACS network. Overall, the card serves as a tangible representation of security measures in place for user authentication.
(if in the Duo app)

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234
 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4): 672239

The image features a Duo hardware token, a compact, oval-shaped device primarily black in color. At the top, the word "DUO" is displayed in bold, modern lettering, instantly recognizable as a brand associated with multi-factor authentication. Below this branding, there is a digital display screen that showcases a six-digit numeric code, "123456," indicating a temporary authentication code used for secure login. To the left of the screen is a prominent green button, suggesting it may be used to generate or confirm the displayed code. The device is attached to a small metal keyring, emphasizing its portability and ease of access for users. Overall, the token's design is minimalistic, straightforward, and functional, encapsulating the essence of security and user-friendly authentication mechanisms prominent in modern cybersecurity practices. The clear display and color contrast enhance readability, making it a practical tool for users needing to verify their identity during login processes.
(if using a hardware token)

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234
 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4): 123456

︗YubiKey tap
Simply tap the sensor on your YubiKey plugged into the device you are using to SSH to have it emit a string of characters and automatically hit Enter.

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234
 2. Duo Push to iPad (iOS)
 3. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234
 4. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234

Passcode or option (1-4): kffuastenhldrhfhadafdarivuntddugrvjvllddjjuget

︗Wrapping up
After finishing your method of choice for using Duo to multi-factor authenticate, you will be logged in and can operate as normal.

Success. Logging you in...
Last login: Wed Feb 17 12:00:00 2021 from ...
[username@nexusgroup00 ~]$

Subsequent SSH attempts from the window you have already connected via will not require multi-factor authentication, even if the host you are trying to SSH to is another public-facing host. This is because at this point the point of origin for the network traffic behind the connection attempt is coming from within the UMIACS border, rather than the rest of the Internet.

[username@nexusgroup00 ~]$ ssh nexusgroup01.umiacs.umd.edu
username@nexusgroup01.umiacs.umd.edu's password:
Last login: Wed Feb 17 11:59:00 2021 from ...
[username@nexusgroup01 ~]$

︗Considerations
Since there is now an additional step to log in to our public-facing hosts if not using our VPN, we would recommend first establishing a connection over our VPN if you anticipate needing to SSH to several different hosts or need to open several different terminal windows concurrently. As mentioned previously, you do not need an additional multi-factor authentication step when using SSH if you first connect to our VPN since it is already secured by multi-factor authentication.
An alternative would be to use a terminal multiplexer(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer) such as Screen or Tmux to minimize the number of times you need to multi-factor authenticate. Terminal multiplexers allow you to start several different processes out of one terminal display, and also detach from and later reattach to each of the processes.

︗Creating service admin user on macOS

From UMIACS
(Redirected from Creating service admin user on OSX)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
When taking an Apple product to the Terrapin Tech store(The prior text links to https://it.umd.edu/terrapin-tech), it is critical that you create a Service Admin User on your computer before having it serviced. The technicians at the store require an admin user name and password, and if the pre-existing password is the same as your UMIACS domain login password, revealing it to the technicians would represent a security vulnerability. To remedy this, you must create a new temporary user account with administrator privileges that the technicians can use to service your machine. 

︗Creating the new account
Make sure you are logged in to an administrator account on your MacBook.
Navigate to System Preferences. (Click on the Apple Logo at the top lefthand side of the screen, and select "System Preferences" from the dropdown menu.)
From the System Preferences menu, select "Users and Groups" .
On the righthand side of the screen where it lists the users currently on the machine, click on the 'Add User' button.
By default, the new account will be set to a Standard account. Select the "New User" dropdown menu and choose "Administrator" from the list.
The image depicts a user interface for creating a new user account on a macOS system. The main panel is dark, highlighting the forms and dropdown menus in a clean, straightforward design. At the top, the "New User" section includes a dropdown menu permitting the selection of account types, showing options for "Administrator," "Standard," and "Sharing Only," with "Administrator" currently selected. 

Below this, there are labeled fields for "Full Name," "Account Name," "Password," and "Verify." The "Full Name" field likely instructs the user to input the complete name of the new account holder, while "Account Name" suggests a name for the home folder. The "Password" field has a secured entry, prompting the user to create an original password. A note underneath indicates the password must meet a minimum of four characters. Additionally, there's an optional "Password Hint" field to aid in remembering the password.

At the bottom, the interface offers buttons labeled "Cancel" and "Create User," allowing the user to either abort the action or create the new account. The overall aesthetic is consistent with macOS design, featuring sleek lines and a minimalist approach.
The new user's full name should be "Service Admin," and the account name should be "serviceadmin".
The password is up to you, so long as it's not the same as your UMIACS account password or your UMD Directory ID password.
The image showcases a user interface for creating a new user account on a macOS system, set against a dark background typical of the macOS aesthetic. At the top of the panel, labeled "New User," a dropdown menu is visible, which is currently set to "Administrator," indicating the type of account being created. Below this, there are input fields clearly labeled for "Full Name," "Account Name," and "Password," each occupying separate lines.

The "Full Name" field is pre-filled with "Service Admin," which is the designated full name for the account. The "Account Name" field contains "serviceadmin," indicating the name for the home folder associated with this new user. The "Password" and "Verify" fields contain obscured inputs, ensuring security, with a note below them stating password requirements—specifically, that it must have at least four characters.

Additionally, a "Password Hint" field is included, suggesting a hint to help remember the password. At the bottom of the panel, there are two buttons: "Cancel" on the left, allowing users to abort the process, and "Create User" on the right to finalize the account creation. The overall layout is clean and minimalist, aligning with modern design principles.
Select "Create User".
When prompted by the Terrapin Tech sore, you should give this account's credentials to the technician, not your UMIACS account credentials. Once the service is completed, the account can be deleted.

︗Microsoft Office Activation

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
This article is about how to manually force Microsoft Office to activate and obtain a license from the university KMS server.

︗Contents

1 When do I need to do this?
2 How to Activate Office

2.1 Simple Activation Method
2.2 Command Line Activation Method




︗None
Most users will not need to do this in order to use Microsoft Office. The only time this will need to be done is if Office is installed on a host that goes an extended length of time (180 days or more) without connecting to the campus network (either physically or through a VPN) and needs to be activated in a hurry.

︗How to Activate Office
Please note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN(The prior text links to https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/1840), or the  UMIACS VPN to activate. The below steps will assume you have already established a network connection. Please also note that your time must be correct (i.e. set via the Internet) and set to the US Eastern timezone for this to work. You can try running w32tm /resync on the command line below in step 4 before running the other commands listed in that step and subsequent ones to resync your time if the commands fail at first.
Once you are on the campus network follow these instructions:

︗Simple Activation Method
Open any Office product (Word, PowerPoint, etc.). This should automatically activate Office. If it fails to activate, follow the instructions below:

︗Command Line Activation Method
Please note that your time must be correct for this to work, make sure you are in the East Coast timezone and your time is set via the internet, try running "w32tm /resync" on the command line.

Search for Command Prompt in the Start menu, right click it, and choose "Run as administrator".
The image depicts the Windows search interface showing the "Command Prompt" application. On the left side, there is a search bar with the text “command prompt” entered, which has auto-generated suggestions below. The most prominent suggestion is “Command Prompt” itself, highlighted in blue. 

To the right of this suggestion, options are presented under the app name, including "Open" for launching the application normally, “Run as administrator” for opening it with elevated privileges, “Open file location” for navigating to the app's installation directory, and “Pin to taskbar” for creating a shortcut on the taskbar for easy access.

The overall user interface has a dark theme with a grey background, blending into a black rectangle representing the Command Prompt icon, which typically signifies a command-line interface. The search results appear in a rectangular box, comprising various user interface elements typical of Windows operating systems. The browser at the bottom of the image indicates some web-related functionality, suggesting that the user may access additional resources or information directly from the search results.
Run the following command to determine the bitness of your operating system. This will help you determine which commands you need to run as you continue:
wmic os get osarchitecture
The image showcases a Command Prompt interface on a Windows operating system. The black rectangular window displays a command line with a white text output. The command entered is "wmic os get osarchitecture," followed by the response "OSArchitecture" and "64-bit," indicating the system's architecture. The cursor is positioned at the end of the command line, suggesting readiness for further input.

The interface is minimalistic, with the typical Command Prompt aesthetic — a dark background and light-colored text. This specific layout allows users to execute commands and view system information quickly. Surrounding elements typical of Windows, including the title bar (not fully visible), suggest that the application is running in a standard windowed mode. Overall, the image effectively captures a specific interaction with the Windows Command Prompt, reflecting a technical and informational context relevant to users familiarizing themselves with system architecture commands.
The path entered for the rest of the commands will differ slightly depending on the bitness of your operating system and your version and bitness of Office. See here(The prior text links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) for how to check Office version and bitness. The remaining instructions assume Office 2016 (or newer) 64-bit on Windows 64-bit.
64-bit Office, 64-bit Windows: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS"
32-bit Office, 64-bit Windows: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS"
32-bit Office, 32-bit Windows: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS"
Set the correct KMS server.
cscript "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS" /sethst:kms.umd.edu
The image displays a Command Prompt interface on a Windows operating system, characterized by its black background and light green text. At the top of the window, the command input indicates the directory path as "C:\WINDOWS\system32>". Below this, the user has executed a script with the command `cscript "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS" /sethst:kms.umd.edu`. The output text confirms successful execution of the command with the message "Successfully applied setting," framed by lines of dashes that add a structured aesthetic to the display. 

The Command Prompt is visually minimalist, focused on text output without additional graphic elements. The version of Windows Script Host is noted as "Version 5.812," providing context about the environment in which the command is running. This environment is typical for users attempting to activate Microsoft Office via a KMS server, making the image relevant to IT professionals and students needing these activation commands. The overall simplicity emphasizes the command line's functionality over visual flair, aligning with standard technical documentation styles.
Force an activation against the KMS server.
cscript "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS" /act
The image captures a Command Prompt window on a Windows operating system, displaying the process of activating Microsoft Office via the command line. The window features a dark background with light gray text, typical of the Command Prompt's minimal interface design. The command executed is `cscript "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS" /act`, indicating an attempt to activate the Office installation. 

Above this command, there is a line stating "Processing..." followed by various detailed outputs, including an "Installed product key detected" message that describes the Office version and product information. The SKU ID, license name, and license description indicate that the product is "Office 16, Office16ProPlusVL_KMS_Client edition," along with a note about the activation status. It confirms "<Product activation successful>" towards the end, indicating that the activation process was completed without errors.

The interface conveys a clear technical context, relevant to users engaging with system-level scripts for software activation, and is visually focused on functionality rather than aesthetics.
Check the licensing status.
cscript "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS" /dstatus
This example shows 1 license, being the standard Office installation.
The image displays a Command Prompt interface on a Windows operating system, characterized by its classic dark theme and light text. The command input shows a path: `C:\WINDOWS\system32>`, indicating the current directory in the system. Below this line, the user executed the command `cscript "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPP.VBS" /dstatus`, which is intended to check the licensing status of Microsoft Office. 

The output presents a series of structured lines detailing important licensing information. It displays the PRODUCT ID and SKU ID, confirming the Office version as "Office 16, Office16ProPlusVL_KMS_Client edition." The LICENSE STATUS reveals that the license is currently in a valid state, albeit with a note marking it as "---LICENSED---". It also shows an ERROR CODE (0x400F040) that prompts the user to ensure the product is activated. Additional details include a REMAINING GRACE period of 179 days, indicating time left before the license needs to be renewed. 

Overall, the image captures a technical context essential for users checking the activation status of their Microsoft Office installation, with a focus on clarity and function over aesthetics.

The recommended choice of development environment for Java is the Sun ONE Development Studio, formerly known as Forte for Java. It is backed by Sun, the creator of Java, and is freely available. It is written entirely in Java, therefore you can run it on any OS and platform for which JDK is available, including Unix, Linux, Windows and Mac. See the Sun site for more information: http://wwws.sun.com/software/sundev/jde/index.html(The prior text links to http://wwws.sun.com/software/sundev/jde/index.html)
An alternative is Borland's JBuilder. We've had negative feedback on this product from our users in the past.
Microsoft's Visual J++ (version 6 and the .NET version) is not compatible with the new language specifications and therefore is not recommended.

Password was not previously used in last 5 passwords.
Password has not been  compromised in a known data breach.
It is your responsibility to secure your password. Please choose a strong password, do not use your UMIACS password for any other service, and only connect using secure protocols.
UMIACS staff members do not store your password in a retrievable format, so if you forget your password, you must reset it (next section).

︗Changing account password
︗If you know your current password
You can use the UMIACS Password Web Application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/password) to change your password.
︗If you do not know your current password
You can reset your password yourself(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/password/forgot) if you know your username and have already registered a mobile phone number and alternate E-mail address in our Directory Application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/info/).
If your account was a UMIACS Collaborator Account, your password can be reset by your sponsor via our Requests Application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/collaborators/).
You can stop by the UMIACS Help Desk in room 3109 Iribe Center with a photo ID.
If you are unable to physically stop by the UMIACS Help Desk, you can have your account sponsor (PI) work with the UMIACS Help Desk to receive a temporary password on your behalf.  The account sponsor will then be responsible for conveying the password to you in a secure manner. (e.g., Telephone, where they could identify you by voice)
︗Sponsored Accounts
You can view a list of the accounts you sponsor in the UMIACS Account Management Web Application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/sponsored/). Clicking on an account's display name will bring you to a management page where you can see details such as the installation date or email forward. From here you can edit your relationship to the account.
You can also request to remove your sponsorship or modify the expiration date, but these require staff action and are not immediate.

︗WindowsServicing

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Windows periodically releases "feature updates" that are designed to bring a large set of new features to all machines that can run Windows. They are typically released annually by Microsoft.
At UMIACS, we release these feature updates to be installed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as Enterprise supported laptops and home machines via our Windows Patch Management. We typically release feature updates to be installed several months after Microsoft releases them to the general public to ensure that the targeted release is compatible with all software that we run, such as our VPN.

︗Current Feature Release at UMIACS
The current feature releases we deploy at UMIACS are:



OS Version

Feature Release


Windows 10

22H2


Windows 11

23H2

We deployed the current Windows 10 feature release on March 15th, 2023 and the current Windows 11 feature release on April 10th, 2024.
The current Windows 10 feature release is the final one being released by Microsoft. Windows 10 reaches end of support on October 14th, 2025.
For a comprehensive list of what is new in these feature updates, please see Microsoft's documentation:

10: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-22h2(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-22h2)

︗Updating
Our Windows Patch Management automatically installs feature updates when we release them to our supported Windows desktops and Enterprise supported laptops. You will receive a notification to install the feature update in the same way that other patches are installed. Please see that page for an example of what the process looks like.
Please note that feature updates often have supplemental updates (i.e. security patches) that must install after the feature update itself. This means that in addition to the reboot issued as part of the feature update install process, additional reboots may be required while installing the supplemental updates thereafter. This is by design. You can defer each reboot that is required as specified on our Windows Patch Management page.

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol)) is a network protocol used to securely transfer and manage files on remote systems.  SFTP is layered on top of the SSH protocol, and is preferred over FTP as a method of remote file transfer.
Warning: running interactive programs in your shell initialization files, such as starting another shell, causes SFTP to fail. See Shell on how to correctly change the shell you are using

︗Connecting to an SFTP Server
Under Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to a remote host.

sftp bkirz@$HOSTNAME.umiacs.umd.edu 
Replace $HOSTNAME with the name of the host you are trying to connect.
For UMIACS supported Windows hosts, a SFTP client is already installed. For other hosts, you can download and install winSCP(The prior text links to http://winscp.net/eng/download.php), which will enable SSH and SFTP access.

︗Further Information
More information about SFTP can be found at http://www.openssh.org/(The prior text links to http://www.openssh.org/).

3 Controlling Access to your Collaborators

3.2 Viewing Security Groups




︗Collaborator Account Introduction
UMIACS provides  collaborator accounts to facilitate collaboration with non-UMIACS Faculty, Staff and Employees. These accounts can access resources such as GitLab, UMobjstore, Wikis, and other web-based applications. These accounts do not have storage and access to UMIACS workstations, however.

︗None
A UMIACS Account holder has to sponsor the Collaborator Account.   This is done in our UMIACS Requests Application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/collaborators/new).  This will send an email to the Collaborator to set their details (including a username and password).  Once the Collaborator has created their account, an email will be sent to both the account sponsor and the Collaborator that the account is ready to use.

︗Services Offered
Collaborators can access GitLab, the Object Store, as well as other web applications.

︗GitLab
GitLab is a source code collaboration software based on Git(The prior text links to https://git-scm.com/) source control management.  It supports built-in project wikis, code review, and issue tracking for each project.  All Collaborators automatically get GitLab access.  Although Collaborators can modify any of the repos you add them to, they do not get an allocation to create projects of their own.

︗Object Store
UMobjstore is the web application component complementing UMobj, the command-line utility used to interact with the Object Store. UMobjstore gives users a convenient interface to our Ceph Object Stores which are distributed across different machines, so that machines can fail and the cluster keep functioning.

︗Wikis
Wikis are great for providing collaborative web spaces. In order to access a particular wiki, a Collaborator will first have to be added to the respective SecGroup.

︗Controlling Access to your Collaborators
︗Security Groups
SecGroup are authentication groups that give PIs the ability to manage which users should have access to different applications that they manage.  They provide fine-grained access control to wikis, source code repositories, and certain web applications.

︗Viewing Security Groups
You can view which SecGroups you can grant access to through the directory app: https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/)

︗Quarantine Passthrough
If you wish to have the mail that would ordinarily be quarantined by Barracuda delivered to your mailbox instead you can configure this using the Barracuda web interface. You can log in to the system using any of our firewalls using your UMIACS email address (username@umiacs.umd.edu) and password:
bubs.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://bubs.umiacs.umd.edu)
pompom.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://pompom.umiacs.umd.edu)
Once you have successfully logged in, click the Preferences tab at the top of the screen. Then select Quarantine Settings.
The image features a screen from the Barracuda Email Security Gateway interface, specifically focusing on the "Quarantine Settings." The layout is predominantly white and light gray with blue accents. At the top, the Barracuda logo is displayed, followed by the title "Email Security Gateway." 

The interface consists of several clearly defined sections. The first section titled "Quarantine Enable/Disable" includes radio buttons for options labeled "Yes" and "No," allowing users to enable or disable email quarantine. Below this, a note explains that if "No" is selected, emails normally quarantined will be delivered to the user’s mailbox with a "[QUARANTINE]" tag. 

The second section, "Quarantine Notification," provides options to set the frequency for receiving notifications about quarantined messages, with choices like "Daily," "Weekly," and "Never." Below this, there is a field for entering an email address for notifications.

The "Default Language" section specifies the default language for the interface (English, iso-8859-1). A "Save" and "Cancel" button are located at the bottom right, in addition to a help button for user assistance. The overall design is functional and user-friendly, designed for practical navigation.

On this screen there is a selection box for Quarantine Enable/Disable. By changing this option to "No" all mail that would be captured by the Barracuda quarantine filter will instead be delivered to your mailbox with the tag [QUAR] prepended to the subject line. Click Save Changes and you're done.
The image displays a user interface screen from the Barracuda Email Security Gateway, specifically focusing on the "Quarantine Settings." The layout features a clean, predominantly white background with light gray sections and blue accents, creating an organized and accessible appearance. At the top, the Barracuda logo is visible, followed by the title "Email Security Gateway."

The interface is divided into three main sections. The first section, titled "Quarantine Enable/Disable," includes two radio buttons labeled "Yes" and "No," allowing users to choose whether to enable email quarantine. An explanatory note beneath states that selecting "No" will result in quarantined emails being delivered to the user's mailbox with a "[QUARANTINE]" tag in the subject line.

The second section, "Quarantine Notification," offers options to set the frequency of notification emails regarding quarantined messages, with choices for daily, weekly, or never. There is also a designated field for entering the email address for receiving these notifications.

The third section, labeled "Default Language," indicates a selection box for language preferences, with English (iso-8859-1) pre-selected. At the bottom right of the interface are "Save" and "Cancel" buttons, along with a help button for additional support. Overall, the interface design prioritizes functionality and ease of navigation for users.

︗Filtering the Quarantined messages from your inbox
Since the quarantine filter will no longer catch mail that would have been previously removed from your inbox, you may wish to set up a filter to redirect these messages to an appropriate folder.

Solstice(The prior text links to https://www.mersive.com/products/solstice/) is a wireless and content sharing solution. It enables multiple users to connect simultaneously to a shared display using laptops and mobile devices over an existing wireless network without the need for cables or additional hardware.
All conference rooms in the  Brendan Iribe Center and some in the  Atlantic Building are equipped with Solstice Mersive Pods(The prior text links to https://www.mersive.com/product/the-solstice-pod/).

3 How to Connect to a Display
4 Mirror Your iOS Device Screen Using AirPlay
5 Share Your Windows Device Screen Using Miracast


︗Welcome Screen
When viewing a Solstice display that does not have a current collaboration session, you will see the Welcome Screen containing the Solstice display name, a screen key, network information, user connection instructions, and the Solstice display menu.
The image shows a Solstice display screen set in a conference room environment, predominantly featuring a picturesque mountain landscape in the background, characterized by rugged peaks adorned with snow and a sunset casting warm hues of red and orange on the mountainside. Superimposed on this serene backdrop is the text "Round Table" prominently displayed at the top in bold white font, indicating the name of the conference room. 

On the right side of the screen, there is a white rectangular box detailing network information and connection instructions. It includes headings for "Ethernet" and "Miracast," listing the respective connection details: "Ethernet: 192.168.34.2" and "Miracast: 192.168.34.132." Below these headings, there is a brief instruction: "Apple devices can AirPlay to Round Table," guiding users on how to connect their devices to the display. The current time is shown as "2:11 pm" at the bottom left in a simple, unobtrusive font, completing the informational layout of the screen. The overall color palette combines natural tones of the landscape with modern digital interface elements, creating an inviting atmosphere for collaboration.

︗Downloading Solstice User App
 Solstice User App
︗How to Connect to a Display
Ensure you are connected to either the UMD wireless or wired network.
Open the Solstice user app.
Search for a specific display by name/IP in the search bar.
When prompted, enter in the screen key listed on the Solstice display.
The user app will join the collaboration session with full media posting and control rights.
︗Mirror Your iOS Device Screen Using AirPlay
Solstice supports full mirroring of iOS 7+ devices (Apple iPhones and iPads) that feature Apple’s AirPlay functionality. AirPlay mirroring is accomplished through the device’s native AirPlay feature, using a similar process as connecting to an Apple TV.

Ensure the iOS device is on the WiFi network used to connect to the Solstice display.
Swipe upward from the bottom or downward from the upper-right corner of your screen to open the iOS Control Center.
Tap the Screen Mirroring button and select the desired Solstice display from the list that appears.
If the desired display does not appear in the AirPlay menu of your device, open the Solstice App and connect to the desired display, then repeat steps 2 and 3.
If prompted, enter the screen key visible on the Solstice display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.
To stop mirroring your screen to the display, swipe upward from the bottom or downward from the upper-right corner of your screen to open the iOS Control Center, tap the Airplay button, then tap Stop Mirroring.
︗Share Your Windows Device Screen Using Miracast
If your organization has enabled streaming with Miracast, users without the Solstice user app can connect and share their screen to the display using Miracast capabilities on their Windows device. 
Screen mirroring on an Android device may not support audio streaming.

On your Windows laptop, hit the Windows key + P.
In the menu that appears, click Connect to a wireless display. A list of displays appears. Note: If the display is enabled for Miracast but you do not see it in the list of available displays, try scrolling down to ensure it is not hidden.
Select the Solstice display. If prompted for a PIN, enter the screen key from the display. Your device will connect wirelessly to the display and your screen will be streamed in real-time.
To change how your device handles the display, hit the Windows key + P, then select one of the display options that appear. Mersive recommends using the Duplicate setting when streaming with Miracast.
To stop Miracast streaming to the display, hit the Windows key + P, click Connect to a wireless display, then click Disconnect.

1 Overview
2 Prerequisites
3 Procedure

3.1 Inactivity




︗Overview
In addition to the  nightly backups we perform for our supported Windows workstations or the  cloud storage UMD offers for other university-owned devices, you may want to create your own personal backups of data stored on our devices. There are many backup software solutions available, but this article will focus on using Windows' built-in backup tool, File History(The prior text links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027408/windows-10-backup-and-restore).
We strongly encourage encrypting your backups. Please see BitLocker/PersonalUse for instructions on how to prepare an encrypted portable hard drive to use for backups.

︗Prerequisites
A portable hard drive formatted with the NTFS file system.
Any desktop edition of Windows 10/11.
︗Procedure
Insert your portable hard drive into any USB slot and search File History in the start menu to open the Backup settings system settings item.

2 lpr
3 nscript
4 lprm
5 lpq
6 Generate Postscript
7 Preview your job
8 Choose a print queue
9 Send a print job
10 Monitor a print job
11 Remove a Print Job


︗Introduction
UMIACS uses the LPRng spooling system to provide both a Berkeley UNIX interface to our network printing system.
The commands are located in /usr/local/bin. They include the programs 'lpr', 'lprm', 'lpq', and 'lpstat'.
All of the UNIX queues are configured to handle postscript. See the examples section for more information on how to print different file types.
Basic Commands

︗lpr
Use `lpr -Pprintername filename.ps` to submit the postscript file named filename.ps to the printer queue named printername. If no filename is specified, lpr reads from standard input. If no printer name is specified, then the job is discarded by the print server.
Additional options to specify media handling, page orientation, and double sided printing can be passed to the print spooler using one or more -Z options. Double sided printing is specified with -Zduplex. Page orientation is controlled with -Zportrait, -Zlandscape. Manual feed media (eg. transparencies) is specified with -Zmanual. Please note that not all printers support all -Z options.

︗nscript
Use `nscript -Pprintername filename.txt` to send the text file named filename.txt to the printer named printername. If no filename is specified, then nscript reads from standard input.
Nscript is a weak attempt to simulate Adobe Systems Incorporated nscript programs. It supports a handful of interesting arguments. With the '-G' argument, nscript generates gaudy output that includes header information on each page. The '-2' argument generates two column output and '-r' rotates the job's orientation to landscape mode.

︗lprm
Use 'lprm -Pprintername' to remove jobs from the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it removes the first removable job in the queue. Given a job's id as an argument, it will remove the specified job from the queue and you can remove all removable jobs from a queue with the argument "all".
You are able to remove items from the queue that you have submitted from anywhere, not just the computer from which the job was submitted.

︗lpq
Use 'lpq -Pprintername' to get the status of the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it will print the printer queue, the host queried, and the number of jobs in the queue. With the -l argument, it will specify the id, queue rank, the total size of the job in bytes, and any errors encountered in processing the job.

︗Generate Postscript
Postscript is a Page Description Language that is understood by high quality printers and typically generated by applications. There is a lot of documentation about using and programming in postscript, but for our purposes you'll just need to generate postscript from an existing text file.
You can generate postscript from an existing text file with textps. For example, to convert the Message of the Day file to a postscript file try `textps ... > file.ps`.

︗Preview your job
It's helpful to preview your postscript files before printing by calling Ghostview with `ghostview file.ps`.
Higher quality previewing is available using Ghostview's derivativegv. You can call it as `gv file.ps`.
Both commands should open a window that displays the contents of your postscript file.

︗Choose a print queue
Print queues are described here:  Print Queues.
You can check list all the print queues with `lpq -a` and you can list just a single queue `lpq -Pprintername` -- eg. ps432-3208 with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.

︗Send a print job
After you choose a suitable printer (eg. ps432-3208), you can send your postscript file to the printer with `lpr -Pps432-3208 file.ps`.

︗Monitor a print job
You can monitor the job you sent to the printer (eg. ps432-3208) with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.
Lpq will return the following output:

[herzog 33] lpq -Pps432-3208
Printer: ps432-3208@lpr1 (dest raw@ps432-3208.umiacs.umd.edu) 'HP M653 in IRB 3208'
Queue: 2 printable jobs
Server: pid 11833 active
Unspooler: pid 11837 active
Status: waiting for subserver to exit at 14:50:45.141
Rank   Owner/ID                  Class Job Files                 Size Time
active username@herzog+198           A   198 file.ps               4309 14:50:44
2      username2@prime+199           A   199 hpss.ps               4309 14:50:45
Active connection from  128.8.120.247
Waiting connection from 128.8.120.247

︗Remove a Print Job
If you would like to remove your job from the queue, you should get the job's id from the output of `lpq`. You can remove it with `lprm -Pps432-3208 198`
From the output of lpq, I can see that the job id is 198 and I can remove it with lprm as follows:

[herzog 35] lprm -Pps432-3208 198
Printer ps432-3208@durer:
checking perms 'username@herzog+198'
dequeued 'username@herzog+198'

Often the last job listed in the printer queue has already spooled to the printer, and lprm will be unable to delete the job.  In this case, the only way to cancel the job will be to press the 'cancel' button on the printer.

︗WebCrawling

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Web crawling, scraping, or otherwise downloading large sets of publicly available information on the Internet (hereafter referred to as just "crawling") should be handled with care.
You should always understand if any publicly accessible data you are planning on crawling is encumbered or not.  Some things that are publicly accessible are still under copyright and it is important to understand what the restrictions are on any data that you crawl from remotely accessible sites.
There are a number of different organizations that still give access to academic institutions (such as UMIACS) through IP based filtering, but have restrictions on crawling.  The services that they provide may also not be adequately built for programmatic crawling.  In this case, these organizations may ban IP addresses or ranges if crawling is observed on those IP addresses or ranges.  This can then prevent other individuals from using these services from the same IP addresses or ranges. In the case of UMIACS, bad behavior on the part of a single user from UMIACS systems can result in all access to a service being banned from UMIACS' public IP addresses.
Some examples of databases or sites that may have restrictions on crawling are (not an exhaustive list):

University of Maryland Library Resources - https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=326950&p=2194463(The prior text links to https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=326950&p=2194463)
NCBI - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/(The prior text links to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/)
You should never try to evade limitations or restrictions imposed by the site or owner for publicly available service that you are looking to crawl.

︗EnvironmentalVariables

From UMIACS
(Redirected from MPATH)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
In UNIX and Windows many of the commands run have variables that are parsed from a user's environment.

︗None
The most common variable is the PATH variable, which will add additional paths to search for programs to be run from the command line. These can be set in many ways but we will cover the most popular: tcsh and bash. You can see your PATH variable by using the built-in echo command in the shell.  When printing out environment variables you will need to prefix the variable with the $ sign.

$ echo $PATH
/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

In almost all cases you will want to append to either the beginning or end of your PATH variable and not replace it fully as this will most likely decrease the functionality of your shell.  For example, if you wanted to add the path /opt/UMtorque/bin to the end of your PATH then you could do the following,

tcsh/csh
setenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin
bash/sh
export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin
These can be either typed into your shell directly or added to your shell's initialization files so every time you spawn a shell it will get this new PATH.

︗None
To modify the Windows PATH Environmental Variable do the following: 

Go to Control Panel and click on User Accounts. Then click on the User Accounts heading within User Accounts.
On the left pane, click Change my environment variables.
Under User Variables for <username> choose the PATH variable.
If there is none, click New and put PATH for the Variable name.
Click Edit and append the location you are trying to add. Different paths are separated by semicolons.
To verify that the PATH variable has been modified properly do the following:

Open a new Command Prompt (Start -> Accessories -> Command Prompt).
Type in PATH.
The updated PATH should be printed.

From UMIACS
(Redirected from OpenLAB)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The Nexus is the combined scheduler of resources in UMIACS.  The resource manager for Nexus is SLURM.  Resources are arranged into partitions where users are able to schedule computational jobs.  Users are arranged into a number of SLURM accounts based on faculty, lab, or center investments.

︗Contents

1.1 Access
1.2 Jobs

1.2.1 Interactive

4.3 Faculty Allocations
4.4 Project Allocations
4.5 Datasets




︗Getting Started
All accounts in UMIACS are sponsored.  If you don't already have a UMIACS account, please see Accounts for information on getting one.  You need a full UMIACS account (not a  collaborator account) in order to access Nexus.

︗Access
Your access to submission nodes (alternatively called login nodes) for Nexus computational resources is determined by your account sponsor's department, center, or lab affiliation.  You can log into the UMIACS Directory CR application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/cr/) and select the Computational Resource (CR) in the list that has the prefix nexus.  The Hosts section lists your available submission nodes - generally a pair of nodes of the format nexus<department, lab, or center abbreviation>[00,01], e.g., nexusgroup00 and nexusgroup01.
Note - UMIACS requires multi-factor authentication through our Duo instance.  This is completely discrete from both UMD's and CSD's Duo instances.  You will need to enroll one or more devices to access resources in UMIACS, and will be prompted to enroll when you log into the Directory application for the first time.
Once you have identified your submission nodes, you can SSH directly into them.  From there, you are able to submit to the cluster via our SLURM workload manager.  You need to make sure that your submitted jobs have the correct account, partition, and qos.

︗Jobs
SLURM jobs are  submitted by either srun or sbatch depending if you are doing an interactive job or batch job, respectively.  You need to provide the where/how/who to run the job and specify the resources you need to run with.
For the who/where/how, you may be required to specify --account, --partition, and/or --qos (respectively) to be able to adequately submit jobs to the Nexus.
For resources, you may need to specify --time for time, --ntasks for CPUs, --mem for RAM, and --gres=gpu for GPUs in your submission arguments to meet your requirements.  There are defaults for all four, so if you don't specify something, you may be scheduled with a very minimal set of time and resources (e.g., by default, NO GPUs are included if you do not specify --gres=gpu).  For more information about submission flags for GPU resources, see  here.  You can also can run man srun on your submission node for a complete list of available submission arguments.
For a list of available GPU types on Nexus and their specs, please see Nexus/GPUs.

︗Interactive
Once logged into a submission node, you can run simple interactive jobs.  If your session is interrupted from the submission node, the job will be killed.  As such, we encourage use of a terminal multiplexer such as Tmux.

$ srun --pty --ntasks=4 --mem=2gb --gres=gpu:1 nvidia-smi -L
GPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-ae5dc1f5-c266-5b9f-58d5-7976e62b3ca1)

︗Batch
Batch jobs are scheduled with a script file with an optional ability to embed job scheduling parameters via variables that are defined by #SBATCH lines at the top of the file.  You can find some examples in our SLURM/JobSubmission documentation.

︗Partitions
The SLURM resource manager uses partitions to act as job queues which can restrict size, time and user limits.  The Nexus has a number of different partitions of resources.  Different Centers, Labs, and Faculty are able to invest in computational resources that are restricted to approved users through these partitions.
Partitions usable by all non-class account users:

Nexus/Tron - Pool of resources available to all UMIACS and CSD faculty and graduate students.
Scavenger - Preemption(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html) partition that supports nodes from multiple other partitions.  More resources are available to schedule simultaneously than in other partitions, however jobs are subject to preemption rules.  You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.  The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again. For an overview of things you can check within scripts to determine if your job was preempted/resumed, see SLURM/Preemption.
Partitions usable by ClassAccounts:

 Class - Pool available for UMIACS class accounts sponsored by either UMIACS or CSD faculty.
Partitions usable by specific lab/center users:

Nexus/CBCB - CBCB lab pool available for CBCB lab members.
Nexus/CLIP - CLIP lab pool available for CLIP lab members.
Nexus/CML - CML lab pool available for CML lab members.
Nexus/GAMMA - GAMMA lab pool available for GAMMA lab members.
Nexus/MBRC - MBRC lab pool available for MBRC lab members.
Nexus/MC2 - MC2 lab pool available for MC2 lab members.
Nexus/Vulcan - Vulcan lab pool available for Vulcan lab members.
︗None
SLURM uses Quality of Service (QoS) both to provide limits on job sizes (termed by us as "job QoS") as well as to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user or per group (termed by us as "partition QoS").

︗Job QoS
Job QoS are used to provide limits on the size of job that you can run. You should try to allocate only the resources your job actually needs, as resources that each of your jobs schedules are counted against your  fair-share priority in the future.

default - Default job QoS. Limited to 4 CPU cores, 1 GPU, and 32GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 3 days.
medium - Limited to 8 CPU cores, 2 GPUs, and 64GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 2 days.
high - Limited to 16 CPU cores, 4 GPUs, and 128GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 1 day.
scavenger - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is both only available in the scavenger partition and the only job QoS available in the scavenger partition. To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.  Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.
You can display these job QoS from the command line using the show_qos command.  By default, the command will only show job QoS that you can access.  The above four job QoS are the ones that everyone can access.

$ show_qos

If you want to see all job QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_qos --all command.

To find out what accounts and partitions you have access to, first use the show_assoc command to show your account/job QoS combinations. Then, use the scontrol show partition command and note the AllowAccounts entry for each listed partition. You are able to submit to any partition that allows an account that you have. If you need to use an account other than the default account nexus, you will need to specify it via the --account submission argument.

︗Partition QoS
Partition QoS are used to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user (MaxTRESPU) or per group (GrpTRES).
To view partition QoS, use the show_partition_qos command.

$ show_partition_qos
                Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES

If you want to see all partition QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_partition_qos --all command. 

$ show_partition_qos --all

NOTE: These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS (i.e., they are not in the AllowQos field for their respective partition). Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.
For example, in the default non-preemption partition (tron), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition.
Lab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two "TRES" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition.
All partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html#backfill) issues with the SLURM scheduler.

If you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an "outer submission script" that repeatedly attempts to run an "inner submission script" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval.
An example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an  array job, and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less.
#!/bin/bash
numjobs=1000
i=0
while [ $i -lt $numjobs ]
do
  while [[ "$(sbatch example_inner.sh 2>&1)" =~ "QOSMaxSubmitJobPerUserLimit" ]]
  do
    echo "Currently at maximum job submissions allowed."
    echo "Waiting for 5 minutes before trying to submit more jobs."
    sleep 300
  done
  i=$(( $i + 1 ))
  echo "Submitted job $i of $numjobs"
done

It is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.

︗Storage
All network storage available in Nexus is currently NFS based, and comes in a few different flavors. Compute nodes also have local storage that can be used.

︗Home Directories
You have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.
Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.
NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.

︗Scratch Directories
Scratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Nexus compute infrastructure:

Network scratch directories
Local scratch directories
Please note that  class accounts do not have network scratch directories.

︗Network Scratch Directories
You are allocated 200GB of scratch space via NFS from /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME> where <USERNAME> is your UMIACS username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is  automounted; you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access it.
You can view your quota usage by running df -h /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>.
You may request a permanent increase of up to 400GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 400GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a  project allocation for this. If you choose to increase your scratch space beyond 400GB, the increased space is also subject to the 270 TB days limit mentioned in the project allocation section before we check back in for renewal. For example, if you request 1.4TB total space, you may have this for 270 days (1TB beyond the 400GB permanent increase). The amount increased beyond 400GB will also count against your faculty member's 20TB total storage limit mentioned below.
This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.

︗Local Scratch Directories
Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on also has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc. and are not backed up or protected in any way.  These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job as they are mounted from disks directly attached to the compute node.  However, you must stage your data within the confines of your job and extract the relevant resultant data elsewhere before the end of your job.
These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our  monthly maintenance windows.  Please make sure you secure any resultant data you wish to keep from these directories at the end of your job.

︗Faculty Allocations
Each faculty member can be allocated 1TB of permanent lab space upon request.  We can also support grouping these individual allocations together into larger center, lab, or research group allocations if desired by the faculty.  Please  contact staff to inquire.
Lab space storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.

︗Project Allocations
Project allocations are available per user for 270 TB days; you can have a 1TB allocation for up to 270 days, a 3TB allocation for 90 days, etc..
A single faculty member can not have more than 20TB of project allocations across all of their sponsored accounts active simultaneously. Network scratch allocation space increases beyond the 400GB permanent maximum also have the increase count against this limit (i.e., a 1TB network scratch allocation would have 600GB counted towards this limit).
Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.
The maximum allocation length you can request is 540 days (500GB space) and the maximum storage space you can request is 9TB (30 day length).
To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:

Project Name (short)
Description
Size (1TB, 2TB, etc.)
Length in days (270 days, 135 days, etc.)
Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any
These allocations are available via /fs/nexus-projects/<project name>.  Renewal is not guaranteed to be available due to limits on the amount of total storage.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you are still in need of the storage allocation.  If renewal is available, you can renew for up to another 270 TB days with reapproval from the original faculty approver.

If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.
If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.
︗Datasets
We have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/nexus-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.
The list of Nexus datasets we currently host can be viewed here(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Nexus).

Please see complete documentation at http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm(The prior text links to http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm).
To get started you will just need to know that everything by default will be installed into your ~/perl5 directory.  You can install a module calling the right version of perl in this case by the following (in this example /opt/local/stow/perl-5.14.2/bin/perl).

 /opt/local/stow/perl-5.14.2/bin/perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(LWP)'

You will need to then make perl aware of this alternate location for perl modules.  You will need to run and copy the output that emits out of this command into your shell intialization files (.cshrc/.tcshrc, .bash_profile, etc..).

 /usr/local/stow/perl-5.14.2/bin/perl -Mlocal::lib

You will then need to log out/log in or source your dot files to get the new variables.

︗Introduction to Kerberos
Kerberos provides a toolkit for reducing the risks associated with insecure networks. It provides a unified password space in which we can manage strong passwords easily and it can prevent your password from being sent across the network as cleartext.

︗Working with Kerberos
When you successfully log into any of our Kerberos authenticated systems, you will be granted a set of credentials which will identify you to other network resources. Most users can take advantage of Kerberos without any detailed knowledge about the system.
The only significant complication for some users is that credentials expire after one week at UMIACS. In some environments, the lack of credentials can cause the user environment to behave erratically as network resources become unavailable.
Whenever possible, we strongly suggest that users log out of their environments nightly.

︗Listing your credentials
It is often useful to examine your current credentials. Using klist, you can verify that your login is correct,

 -bash-4.2$  klist
 Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg
 Default principal: username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU
 
 Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
 05/28/18 11:39:36  05/28/18 18:19:36  krbtgt/AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU

'Default principal' indicates the Kerberos identity of the current process. In this case, the Kerberos principal, 'username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU' indicates that we are authenticated as the user 'username' to the realm 'AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU'.
If your credentials have not been set up correctly, klist will report:

 -bash-4.2$  klist
 klist: No credentials cache found (ticket cache FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg)

︗Single Sign On Services
Kerberos authenticated IMAP and SMTP provide secure and convenient methods for sending and reading mail. Unlike traditional IMAP and SMTP services, your password is never sent over the network as cleartext and your password is not cached on a client.

︗Password Security
Kerberos security depends on the security of your password. Although Kerberos can make secure access to services convenient, it is still your responsibility to secure your password. Please try to choose a strong password and use secure protocols.

From UMIACS

Jump to search


Please provide the images you would like me to describe, and I will generate detailed textual descriptions for each one.

This page is maintained for legacy reasons. You are required to use GitLab for version control.

UMIACS used to provide a centrally managed Subversion service. However as of June 21, 2024, this service has now been fully deprecated.
To have a Subversion repository created you need to just email staff(The prior text links to mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu) and provide the name of your repository and how much initial space you think you will need.
We will give you a URL back with the server https://subversion.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://subversion.umiacs.umd.edu) in it.
By default we will configure all repositories to be private and require authentication for both reading and writing to the Subversion repository.  Authentication is done against our LDAP using SecGroups.

︗Contents

1 Getting Started with Subversion
2 Clients

2.1 Collab.net Subversion Packages
2.2 Security Considerations
2.3 Server Certificate Verification on macOS
2.4 Graphical Clients

2.4.1 OS Integration
2.4.2 Other Clients






︗Getting Started with Subversion
You will first need to check out your repository,

  svn co https://subversion.umiacs.umd.edu/my_url(The prior text links to https://subversion.umiacs.umd.edu/my_url)

This will create a directory in your current working directory with the name of the last part of the URL you just checked out.

 cd my_url

You can now add files by the svn import command, svn add can be used to add file that you have created but is not under revision control yet.
For more information please see the defacto book on Subversion in HTML(The prior text links to http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn-book.html) or PDF(The prior text links to http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn-book.pdf)

︗Clients
Most Linux distributions include subversion clients in the distribution including all our Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients.

︗Collab.net Subversion Packages
These are well packaged subversion command line packages.  You can find ones for Windows, macOS and Solaris.  Please see the community downloads for macOS.
http://www.open.collab.net/downloads(The prior text links to http://www.open.collab.net/downloads)

︗Security Considerations
Command line subversions store your password be default on linux, so you should be careful. In order to disable password caching completely, add the line: "store-passwords = no" to the subversion configuration file on your machine. In order to disable caching for a one time command you can pass the --no-auth-cache option.

︗Server Certificate Verification on macOS
The command-line svn tool that is bundled with macOS through Xcode does not correctly handle the UMIACS subversion server certificate.  In order to verify that you are actually connecting to UMIACS, verify that the following fingerprint matches:

 Fingerprint: cb:4f:c6:74:3e:1a:27:d3:55:e7:4b:5a:89:af:e4:c4:95:ce:fe:32

If this fingerprint matches, you can safely accept the certificate.

This page outlines the steps required to enable Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for the Pulse Secure VPN. Please note that this is mandatory as of May 10th, 2019.

︗Prerequisites
Device enrolled with  UMIACS Duo
︗Configuring MFA
The Pulse VPN multi-factor authentication implementation relies on a secondary authentication source to fulfill the MFA requirement.  As a result, you will be prompted for credentials twice.

First credential: UMIACS password
Second credential: Your preferred MFA verification option:


Secondary Password Value:

Result


push

Send a push verification to your Duo connected device.


phone

Send a phone call verification to your Duo connected device.


<press YubiKey>

If you have a physical YubiKey token then you would press the YubiKey for the one time password.

Please note that registering a YubiKey for use with the VPN requires the UMIACS Tech Staff to program it for you. Please  contact us if you would like to register a YubiKey for this purpose. We only support registering YubiKey tokens for this purpose, no other hardware token.



It seems that you mentioned wanting to provide images for detailed descriptions. However, I don’t see any images attached to your message. Please share the images you'd like described, and I can provide detailed descriptions for each one.

Pro-tip: Select ‘Save Settings’ on the secondary authentication prompt to have Duo automatically use your preferred method.

︗MFA Push Configuration Example:
Connect with your existing Pulse VPN profile.
Enter your UMIACS credentials for the first authentication box and tick "Save settings".
The image displays a user interface for the Pulse Secure VPN connection. The window is rectangular, with smooth edges and a light background color. At the top left, the Pulse Secure logo is present, which features a checkmark and a green icon symbolizing security. 

The main area of the window includes a form for connection details, labeled "Connect to: UMIACS MFA." Beneath this header, there are two input fields: one for "User Name" and another for "Password." The user name field contains the placeholder text "mbaney," indicating a username entry. The password field is obscured by asterisks, signifying that the text typed in is confidential.

Beneath the password entry is a checkbox labeled "Save settings," allowing users to save their credentials for future use. At the bottom of the window, two buttons are visible: "Connect" on the right, highlighted to indicate its primary function, and "Cancel" on the left, presented in a less prominent style. The overall interface is clean and straightforward, aimed at providing a user-friendly experience for VPN access.
Type `push` into the password field on the second authentication box, tick "Save settings", and then click Connect. You should then receive a push to your mobile device to complete authentication. This will occur every time you connect to the VPN going forward.
The image displays a user interface for the Pulse Secure VPN connection. The window is rectangular with smooth edges, featuring a light gray background. At the top left corner, the Pulse Secure logo is visible, characterized by a green checkmark and an icon suggesting security. 

In the main area, there is a heading reading "Connect to: UMIACS MFA," followed by instructions prompting the user to provide necessary credentials. Below this heading, two input fields are present. The first field, labeled "Secondary User Name," contains the placeholder text "mbaney," indicating a sample username. The second field, marked as "Secondary Password," displays obscured text represented by asterisks, ensuring password confidentiality.

Beneath the password field, there is a checkbox labeled "Save settings," allowing users to opt for saving their credentials for future logins. Two buttons located at the bottom of the window offer functionality; "Connect" is prominently styled on the right, while "Cancel" is less emphasized on the left. This interface is designed with user-friendliness in mind, facilitating secure access to the VPN.

︗MonthlyMaintenanceWindow

From UMIACS
(Redirected from Outage)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
 UMIACS staff takes a monthly maintenance window to patch and reboot all UMIACS-supported hosts and services.  This provides a way to ensure security updates are installed and activated on the numerous different platforms and appliances that we maintain.
The window for each month is calculated by adding 9 days to Microsoft's Patch Tuesday(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday) to allow us to marshal patches released that month from Microsoft, Red Hat, Apple, and other OS and application vendors and have enough time to get our systems prepared to reboot.  This translates to the window being on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month.  The window lasts from 5pm-8pm.
Nexus will always have a reservation in place from 4:45pm-8pm on the day of the upcoming window to prevent jobs from being scheduled on compute nodes for the entirety of said window as well as 15 minutes before, to allow jobs to fully end. Any job submitted before the reservation begins that has a time limit that would run into the reservation will be held until at least the end of the reservation (8pm on the day of the window). This is to prevent issues with jobs failing to end properly causing delays in work we have scheduled during the window.
A list of upcoming maintenance windows is as follows, with the next one in bold. Again, the window is on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month, and lasts from 5pm-8pm.

If you are migrating from Backup and Sync, please follow the migration steps  here.

︗Contents

1 Overview
2 Installation
3 Windows Setup
4 Mac Setup


︗Overview
Drive for desktop is an application for Windows and macOS that lets you quickly access Google Drive content directly from your operating system's file browser. Drive for desktop also automatically syncs local files and directories of your choosing to your Google Drive in the background. This allows you to continuously back up your data as you create or modify it on your local machine(s) without needing to manually upload each file to your Google Drive.
For Linux, you can set up Rclone(The prior text links to https://rclone.org/) with a cronjob to copy files to your Google Drive periodically. Instructions to do this can be found  here.

This design emphasizes caution, encouraging users to ensure the legitimacy of their app download before proceeding, reflecting a focus on security and user awareness. Overall, the layout is straightforward and user-friendly, highlighting essential actions while reinforcing good security practices.
Congratulations, Drive for Desktop is now successfully installed! Now, to select the folders you would like to have backed up, you need to go the the "Preferences" page. This can be found by selecting the up arrow in the bottom right corner in your taskbar, then select the Google Drive logo, then select the setting cog in the top of the window that pops-up, then select the "Preferences" option.

The image displays the Google Drive for Desktop interface, positioned on a Windows taskbar. At the top left, a user profile icon displays the email address "kfunka@umd.edu" alongside an indicator showing the user is utilizing 8.2GB of storage. Below this, an "Activity" tab showcases the synchronization status of two items: "Documents" and "My Laptop (1)," both marked with checkmarks, indicating successful syncing.

To the right of the profile section, a cogwheel icon symbolizes settings, inviting the user to adjust preferences. The bottom section of the interface displays a notification that "Everything is up to date," indicating all files are synced and up to date. A bright, circular Google Drive logo in a greenish hue is positioned centrally, signifying the application's function. 

Additionally, the taskbar features standard icons for system utilities, such as battery and network status. The overall appearance is clean and organized, emphasizing functionality and ease of access to Google Drive features directly from the desktop environment.

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The previous standalone cluster for CLIP(The prior text links to https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)'s compute nodes have folded into Nexus as of late 2022.
The Nexus cluster already has a large pool of compute resources made possible through college-level funding for UMIACS and CSD faculty. Details on common nodes already in the cluster (Tron partition) can be found  here.
Please  contact staff with any questions or concerns.

︗Contents

1 Submission Nodes
2 Resources
3 QoS
4 Jobs
5 Storage


︗Submission Nodes
You can SSH to nexusclip.umiacs.umd.edu to log in to a submission host.
If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:

nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu
nexusclip01.umiacs.umd.edu
︗Resources
The CLIP partition has nodes brought over from the previous standalone CLIP Slurm scheduler as well as some more recent purchases. The compute nodes are named clip##.

︗QoS
CLIP users have access to all of the  standard job QoSes in the clip partition using the clip account.
The additional job QoSes for the CLIP partition specifically are:

huge-long: Allows for longer jobs using higher overall resources.
Please note that the partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on the partition-specific nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use.

︗Jobs
You will need to specify --partition=clip and --account=clip to be able to submit jobs to the CLIP partition.

UMIACS conducts backups to provide accidental deletion coverage. We aim to provide 90 days of coverage, at one backup per night. However, this coverage may not be perfect, as our backups are very coarse. Depending on the size of the change and size of the file, backups may be periodically missed. Furthermore, files that change often may not have all versions backed up to 90 days, and files which were created very recently may not be backed up.
If you need anything from our nightly backups, please contact staff with the full path to the directory(s) which you would like to have restored.

︗Job Submission
SLURM offers a variety of ways to run jobs. It is important to understand the different options available and how to request the resources required for a job in order for it to run successfully. All job submission should be done from submit nodes; any computational code should be run in a job allocation on compute nodes. The following commands outline how to allocate resources on the compute nodes and submit processes to be run on the allocated nodes.
The cluster that everyone with a  UMIACS account has access to is Nexus. Please visit the Nexus page for instructions on how to connect to your assigned submit nodes.
Computationally intensive processes run on submission nodes will be terminated. Please submit jobs to be scheduled on compute nodes for this purpose.
For details on how SLURM decides how to schedule jobs when multiple jobs are waiting in a scheduler's queue, please see SLURM/Priority.

︗srun
The srun command is used to run a process on the compute nodes in the cluster. If you pass it a normal shell command (or command that executes a script), it will submit a job to run that shell command/script on a compute node and then return. srun accepts many command line options to specify the resources required by the command passed to it. Some common command line arguments are listed below and full documentation of all available options is available in the man page for srun, which can be accessed by running man srun.

$ srun --qos=default --mem=100mb --time=1:00:00 bash -c 'echo "Hello World from" `hostname`'
Hello World from tron33.umiacs.umd.edu

It is important to understand that srun is an interactive command. By default input to srun is broadcast to all compute nodes running your process and output from the compute nodes is redirected to srun. This behavior can be changed; however, srun will always wait for the command passed to finish before exiting, so if you start a long running process and end your terminal session, your process will stop running on the compute nodes and your job will end. To run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with  sbatch.

︗Common srun Arguments
--job-name=<JOBNAME> Requests your job be named <JOBNAME>
--mem=1g Requests 1GB of memory for your job, if no unit is given MB is assumed
--ntasks=2 Requests 2 "tasks" which map to cores on a CPU for your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each core
--nodes=2 Requests 2 nodes be allocated to your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each node
--nodelist=<NODENAME> Requests to run your job on the <NODENAME> node
--time=dd-hh:mm:ss Requests your job run for dd days, hh hours, mm minutes, and ss seconds
--error=<ERRNAME> Redirects stderr for your job to the <ERRNAME> file
--partition=<PARTITIONNAME> Requests your job run in the <PARTITIONNAME> partition
--qos=<QOSNAME>default Requests your job run with the <QOSNAME> QOS, to see the available QOS options on a cluster, run show_qos
--account=<ACCOUNTNAME> Requests your job runs under the <ACCOUNTNAME> Slurm account, different accounts have different available partitions/QOS
--output=<OUTNAME> Redirects stdout for your job to the <OUTNAME> file
--requeue Requests your job be automatically requeued if it is preempted
--exclusive Requests your job be the only one running on the node(s) it is assigned to. This requires that your job be allocated all of the resources on the node(s). The scheduler does not automatically give your job all of the node's/nodes' resources, however, so if you need more than the default, you still need to request these with --ntasks and --mem
︗Interactive Shell Sessions
An interactive shell session on a compute node can be useful for debugging or developing code that isn't ready to be run as a batch job. To get an interactive shell on a node, use srun with the --pty argument to invoke a shell:

$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash
$ hostname
tron33.umiacs.umd.edu

Please do not leave interactive shells running for long periods of time when you are not working. This blocks resources from being used by everyone else.

︗salloc
The salloc command can also be used to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script. Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation. When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.

$ salloc --qos=default -N 1 --mem=2g --time=01:00:00
salloc: Granted job allocation 159
$ srun /usr/bin/hostname
tron33.umiacs.umd.edu
$ exit
exit
salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 159

Please note that any commands not invoked with srun will be run locally on the submit node. Please be careful when using salloc.

︗sbatch
The sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes. To run a simple Hello World command on the compute nodes you could write a file, helloWorld.sh with the following contents:

#!/bin/bash

srun bash -c 'echo Hello World from `hostname`'

Then you need to submit the script with sbatch and request resources:

$ sbatch --qos=default --mem=1g --time=1:00:00 helloWorld.sh
Submitted batch job 121

SLURM will return a job number that you can use to check the status of your job with squeue:

$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
               121      tron helloWor username  R       0:01      1 tron32

︗Advanced Batch Scripts
You can also write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself. This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one "job step". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node. Since srun is blocks until the command finishes, we use the '&' operator to background the process so that both job steps can run at once; however, this means that we then need to use the wait command to block processing until all background processes have finished.

#!/bin/bash

# Lines that begin with #SBATCH specify commands to be used by SLURM for scheduling

#SBATCH --job-name=helloWorld                                        # sets the job name

srun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &    # use srun to invoke commands within your job; using an '&'
srun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &    # will background the process allowing them to run concurrently
wait                                                                 # wait for any background processes to complete

# once the end of the batch script is reached your job allocation will be revoked

Another useful thing to know is that you can pass additional arguments into your sbatch scripts on the command line and reference them as ${1} for the first argument and so on.

︗More Examples
SLURM/ArrayJobs
︗scancel
The scancel command can be used to cancel job allocations or job steps that are no longer needed. It can be passed individual job IDs or an option to delete all of your jobs or jobs that meet certain criteria.

scancel 255 cancel job 255
scancel 255.3 cancel job step 3 of job 255
scancel --user username --partition=tron cancel all jobs for username in the tron partition
︗Identifying Resources and Features
The sinfo command can show you additional features of nodes in the cluster but you need to ask it to show some non-default options using a command like sinfo -o "%40N %8c %8m %35f %35G".

$ sinfo -o "%40N %8c %8m %35f %35G"

Note that all of the nodes shown by this may not necessarily be in a partition you are able to submit to.
You can identify further specific information about a node using  scontrol with various flags.
There are also two command aliases developed by UMIACS staff to show various node information in aggregate. They are show_nodes and show_available_nodes.

︗show_nodes
The show_nodes command alias shows each node's name, number of CPUs, memory, {OS, CPU architecture, CPU type, GPU architecture (if the node has GPUs)} (as AVAIL_FEATURES), GRES (GPUs), and State. It essentially wraps the sinfo command with some pre-determined output format options and shows each node on its own line, in alphabetical order.
To only view nodes in a specific partition, append -p <partition name> to the command alias.

︗show_available_nodes
The show_available_nodes command alias takes zero or more arguments that correspond to Slurm constructs, resources, or features that you are looking to request a job with and tells you what nodes could theoretically[0,1] run a job with these arguments immediately. It assumes your job is a single-node job.
These arguments are:

--partition: Only include nodes in the specified partition(s).
--account: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified account(s).
--qos: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified QoS(es).
--cpus: Only include nodes with at least this many CPUs free.
--mem: Only include nodes with at least this much memory free. The default unit is MB if unspecified, but any of {K,M,G,T} can be suffixed to the number provided (will then be interpreted as KB, MB, GB, or TB, respectively).
GRES-related arguments:
--gres, --and-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains all of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings.
--or-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains any of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gres if only one GRES type/quantity pairing is specified.
GPU-related arguments:
--gpus, --and-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains all of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings.
--or-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains any of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gpus if only one GPU type/quantity pairing is specified.
Feature-related arguments:
--feature, --and-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains all of the specified feature(s).
--or-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains any of the specified feature(s). Functionally identical to --and-feature if only one feature is specified.
These arguments are also viewable by running show_available_nodes -h.
If your passed argument set does not contain any resource-based arguments (CPUs/RAM/GRES or GPUs), a node is defined as available if it has at least 1 CPU and 1MB of RAM available.
If there are no nodes available that meet your passed argument set, you will receive the message There are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.

︗Footnotes
[0] - As of now, this command alias does not factor in resources occupied by jobs that could be preempted (based on the partition(s) passed to it, if present). This is soon to come.
[1] - This command alias also does not factor in jobs with higher priority values requesting more resources, in the same partition(s), blocking execution of a job submitted with the arguments checked by the command alias. This is due to the complexity of calculating a job's priority value before it is actually submitted.

︗Requesting GPUs
If you need to do processing on a GPU, you will need to request that your job have access to GPUs just as you need to request processors or CPU cores. In SLURM, GPUs are considered "generic resources" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:#. If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec'd GPU.
Note that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs.

︗ConferenceRooms/Recording

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation

︗Background
Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)(The prior text links to https://obsproject.com/) is free and open source software for video recording and live streaming. It is simple to set up and highly customizable. At UMIACS, it is the software we recommend to users looking to either record or stream on either their personal computers or in a conference room or auditorium setting.

︗Conference Quick Setup
Below are steps outlining how to start recording or streaming your meetings. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk. 

Select the source you'd like to route to the computer via the "Shared Media" option on the Crestron control panel. This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.
Download (windows zip file)(The prior text links to https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases) and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.
Set up video.
Click the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.
Ensure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called 'AV Bridge'.
Click OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.
If the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack's default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.
Ensure audio settings look OK.
The default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.
Keep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.
Set up either streaming, recording, or both as follows.
Streaming:

Go to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).
Locate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this.
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard(The prior text links to https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard), near the bottom
Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings(The prior text links to https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings), at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.
Enter your key and hit OK.
Click Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom.
Recording:

Go to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive. We have observed that using external HDDs may introduce dropped frames due to encoding lag because of I/O bottlenecks.
Click Start Recording under the Control pane at the bottom.

This article contains some common issues you may encounter with Ivanti Secure VPN and how to troubleshoot them.

︗Authentication Failure:
This may occur when you've recently changed your password but the Ivanti Secure Access client is still trying to authenticate using your old credentials.
Solution:

Windows:
Open the Ivanti Secure Access client.
Right click on your desired connection and click on Forget Saved SettingsThe image shows a user interface of the Ivanti Secure Access (previously known as Pulse Secure) client, presented in a rectangular pop-up window. The window has a light gray background with a distinctive green header section labeled "Connections." Beneath this header, there is a list that includes a connection named "UMIACS," indicated as "Disconnected." 

To the right of the connection list, there is a green plus icon and several drop-down options displayed in a context menu. The options are "Connect," "Advanced Connection Details...," "Edit," "Delete," and "Forget Saved Settings." The last option is highlighted in blue, indicating it is currently selected. 

At the bottom of the window, there are two buttons: one labeled "Close" and the other containing a logo or design element of the Pulse Secure branding. The year "2010-2021" and the statement "All rights reserved" suggest that this software interface has been in use during that timeframe. The overall aesthetic conveys a professional and functional design, suitable for network management tasks related to VPN connections.
Re-enter your new credentials and reconnect.
macOS:
Open the Ivanti Secure Access client.
Click on the 3 lines on the top left corner of the client (if you are using the New-UX client) and you will see a list of options. Click on Forget SettingsThe image displays the user interface of the Ivanti Secure Access Client, a software application designed for VPN management. The interface is rectangular, predominantly featuring a dark background that contrasts with the bright blue selection for the "Forget Settings" option. At the top, the Ivanti logo is visible, accompanied by a red notification icon suggesting there may be alerts or updates.

On the left side, a vertical navigation menu includes options labeled "UI Mode," "Logs," "About," "Help," and "Exit." The highlighted "Forget Settings" option indicates that it is currently selected, emphasizing its importance for users troubleshooting connection issues.

In the background, a faint image of a landscape can be seen, either blurred or intentionally subdued to keep the focus on the application itself. A plus icon is available on the right, suggesting functionality to add new VPN connections or configurations. This professional interface is structured for clarity, intended to facilitate quick navigation and provide assistance for users facing issues with their VPN connections.
Re-enter your new credentials and reconnect.
Note: If you are using the Classic UI mode. Once you open the Ivanti Secure Access client, right click on the connection and you should see an option to Forget Saved Settings.
︗Upgrade Failure:
We have noticed some issues with VPN client auto upgrade. If you are prompted for an upgrade and the upgrade process is stuck, please delete and reinstall the VPN client! If you continue to have issues, please contact staff@umiacs.umd.edu.

︗None
"Connection Error - General failure. (Error:1300)" - Users who have saved a password or DUO settings may receive error code 1300 when attempting to connect from the client. Please Forget Saved Settings and retry (or) Remove and Re-add the VPN connection on the client.

SLURM is an open-source workload manager designed for Linux clusters of all sizes. It provides three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive or non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.

︗Commands
Below are some of the common commands used in SLURM. Further information on how to use these commands is found in the documentation linked above. To see all flags available for a command, please check the command's manual by using man <COMMAND> on the command line.

︗srun(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html)
srun runs a parallel job on a cluster managed by SLURM.  If necessary, it will first create a resource allocation in which to run the parallel job.

︗salloc(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/salloc.html)
salloc allocates a SLURM job allocation, which is a set of resources (nodes), possibly with some set of constraints (e.g. number of processors per node).  When salloc successfully obtains the requested allocation, it then runs the command specified by the user.  Finally, when the user specified command is complete, salloc relinquishes the job allocation.  If no command is specified, salloc runs the user's default shell.

︗sbatch(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)
sbatch submits a batch script to SLURM.  The batch script may be given to sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified, sbatch will read in a script from standard input.  The batch script may contain options preceded with #SBATCH before any executable commands in the script.

︗squeue(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html)
squeue views job and job step information for jobs managed by SLURM.

︗scancel(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/scancel.html)
scancel signals or cancels jobs, job arrays, or job steps.  An arbitrary number of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a space separated list of specific job and/or job step IDs.

︗sacct(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html)
sacct displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log file or SLURM database in a variety of forms for your analysis.  The sacct command displays information on jobs, job steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output with the use of the --format= option to specify the fields to be shown.

︗sstat(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/sstat.html)
sstat displays job status information for your analysis.  The sstat command displays information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node, Resident Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory (VM).  You can tailor the output with the use of the --fields= option to specify the fields to be shown.

︗Modules
If you are trying to use  GNU Modules in a Slurm job, please read the section of our Modules documentation on  non-interactive shell sessions.  This also needs to be done if the OS version of the compute node you are scheduled on is different from the OS version of the submission node you are submitting the job from.

︗Running Jupyter Notebook on a Compute Node
The steps to run a Jupyter Notebook from a compute node are listed below.

︗Setting up your Python Virtual Environment
 Create a Python virtual environment on the compute node you are assigned and  activate it. Next, install Jupyter using pip by following the steps here(The prior text links to https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#alternative-for-experienced-python-users-installing-jupyter-with-pip). You may also use other environment management systems such as Conda(The prior text links to https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) if desired.

︗Running Jupyter Notebook
After you've set up the Python virtual environment, submit a job, activate the environment within the job, and run the following command on the compute node you are assigned:

jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 --ip=0.0.0.0

This will start running the notebook on port 8889. Note: You must keep this shell window open to be able to connect. If the submission node for the cluster you are using is not accessible via the public internet, you must also be on a machine connected to the UMIACS network or connected to our  VPN in order to access the Jupyter notebook once you start the SSH tunnel, so ensure this is the case before starting the tunnel. Then, on your local machine, run

ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:<NODENAME>:8889 <USERNAME>@<SUBMISSIONNODE>.umiacs.umd.edu

This will tunnel port 8889 from the compute node to port 8888 on your local machine, using <SUBMISSIONNODE> as an intermediate node. Make sure to replace <USERNAME> with your username, <SUBMISSIONNODE> with the name of the submission node you want to use, and <NODENAME> with the name of the compute node you are assigned. Note that this command will not display any output if the connection is successful due to the included ssh flags. You must also keep this shell window open to be able to connect.
For example, assuming your username is username and that you are using the Nexus cluster, have been  assigned the nexusgroup submission nodes, and are assigned compute node tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:

ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:8889 username@nexusgroup.umiacs.umd.edu

You can then open a web browser and type in localhost:8888 to access the notebook.
Notes:

Later versions of Jupyter have token authentication enabled by default - you will need to prepend the /?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX part of the URL provided by the terminal output after starting the notebook in order to connect if this is the case. e.g. localhost:8888/?token=fcc6bd0f996e7aa89376c33cb34f7b80890502aacc97d98e
If the port on the compute node mentioned in the example above (8889) is not working, it may be that someone else has already started a process (Jupyter notebook or otherwise) using that specific port number on that specific compute node. The port number can be replaced with any other ephemeral port(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port) number you'd like, just make sure to change it in both the command you run on the compute node and the ssh command from your local machine.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Screen contains the following information: 






︗Screen

From UMIACS

︗Contents

1 Introduction
2 Usage
3 Common Keyboard Shortcuts
4 Important Notes
5 .screenrc
6 Useful Links


︗Introduction
GNU Screen, or "screen", is a window management program available on UMIACS Linux hosts that allows multiplexing of a single terminal between multiple virtual consoles. Screen is also capable of separating programs from the shell that initially started it which allows a program to continue running even if the connection to the host has been lost. For this reason screen is typically used when a network connection is unstable and the process must remain running even if an SSH connection has dropped. Screen is also useful when a process may be slow and other processes need to be running. 

︗Usage
To invoke screen, simply use the following command in a terminal:

# screen

Alternatively, to start a program with screen:

# screen vi program.c

This will invoke screen and, in the newly-created window, start editing the file program.c in vi.
You can have as many screen sessions as you’d like on a single host, however, keeping track of many sessions can become difficult. As a way to solve this screen offers the capability to give each session a unique name when you start it using the following:

# screen -S [session name]

If you need to end your ssh session, but want your processes to keep running you can detach the screen session with:

# screen -d

Then exit as normal.
If you have multiple screen sessions you can detach and reattach them at any time. To list the current screen sessions running on a host use:

# screen -ls

The output will be similar to this:

# username@tron02:~$ screen -ls
#  There are screens on:
# 	26598.screenTest1	(Detached)
# 	18457.pts-0.tron02	(Detached)
# 2 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-username.

To reconnect to a specific screen session you may use either the screen number or name to reconnect using ‘screen -r’

# username@tron02:~$ screen -r 26598

or

# username@tron02:~$ screen -r screenTest1

︗Common Keyboard Shortcuts
Ctrl-A is the metacharacter for commands in screen; press it before every key command.  Some useful commands in screen:

Ctrl-A + c (Creates a new window.)
Ctrl-A + d (detach from current session)
Ctrl-A + [0-9] (Switches to the window corresponding to the number, window 0 is the first window initialized by screen.)
Ctrl-A + " (Presents a selection of screen windows from which to choose.)
Ctrl-A + Shift-A Rename the current screen window
Ctrl-A + <SPC> / Ctrl-A + <BKSPC> (Switch to the next / previous window.)
Ctrl-A + k (Kill the current window.)
Ctrl-A + \ (Kill the screen session and all its windows.)
See the documentation here(The prior text links to http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.txt) to see a full list of Ctrl-A commands (Section 5.1: Default Key Bindings).

︗Important Notes
If you start a screen session that will run a program within a session that has only one window, such as by issuing the command 

# screen program.c 

then when the program exits the screen session will terminate as well. This has the potential to hide any output you may want from your program since the screen session will exit. To solve this issue you can either make sure your shell is not set to auto-logout, or ensure that you have multiple windows open in the screen session so that it will not terminate when the program exits.

︗.screenrc
Similar to .bashrc, the file .screenrc in a user's home directory can be used to customize a screen session's startup behavior.  Commands listed in this file will be executed upon starting screen, and can be useful to set up your environment to display important information such as the window number and name, the name of the host you're connected to, or altering the key sequences for screen commands. See the link here(The prior text links to http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.txt) for more information about screen commands (Section 5.2: Command Summary).

UMIACS has institutional Matlab licenses through UMD that cover Linux, Windows, and macOS. To access them, you have to be using a University owned computer. Please note that only Matlab versions R2020a and newer are supported by the University's license server.
If you would like to install the institutional version of Matlab on a self-supported machine, please  contact staff and we can provide you install media.

︗Contents

1 Linux
2 Windows
3 macOS
4 License Information

4.1 Toolbox Shortnames


5 Matlab Customizations


︗Linux
Modules are the preferred way to interact with Matlab on UMIACS-supported Linux machines. The Modules page will provide information on adding Matlab into your environment and using it.

︗Windows
All UMIACS-supported Windows machines should come with a pre-installed version of Matlab. Please  contact staff if you would like a later version installed.

︗macOS
Please  contact staff if you would like Matlab installed on a UMIACS-supported macOS machine.

︗License Information
Campus has a limited number of seats for Matlab itself, as well as the various toolboxes, managed by a cluster of network license servers(The prior text links to https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/administer-network-licenses.html). As such, you must have network connectivity to be able to use the University's licenses. When calling functions in a toolbox, Matlab will automatically check out a license for that toolbox, making it temporarily unavailable to other users. If, while attempting to use Matlab, you run into a license manager error stating that the maximum number of users for Matlab has been reached, this likely indicates that all of campus' available licenses are in use. To check the number of licenses available for a specific toolbox, please see the below sections:

︗Toolbox Shortnames
The toolbox names themselves don't always work with licensing commands; rather, Matlab has a set of shortnames which can be passed to these commands. The following are the valid shortnames:

Aerospace_Blockset   
Aerospace_Toolbox
Antenna_Toolbox  
Bioinformatics_Toolbox  
Communication_Blocks  
Communication_Toolbox

If you are having problems, feel free to contact  UMIACS Staff, however please note that the Matlab license servers are hosted by campus' Division of Information Technology.

︗Matlab Customizations
You can tweak your Matlab experience using a file "startup.m". If this file is present in the current working directory where you launch Matlab, it will be executed. You can perform a variety of tasks using this file. These include (but are not limited to) customizing the window environment, setting variables for later use, and enabling use of 3rd party toolboxes. Alternatively, you can use the userpath env variable to set a path other than the current working directory for startup and 3rd party toolbox locations. Please see the following links for more information:

Mathworks: Startup.m(The prior text links to http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlabrc.html)

︗Opening up macOS Finder
To open up macOS Finder, click on the macOS Finder icon on the dock at the bottom of your desktop.

The image features a macOS user interface, specifically displaying the dock at the bottom of the screen. In the dock, various application icons are visible, representing programs typically found on a macOS system. Among these icons, the Finder icon, which resembles a blue and white face within a square, is highlighted with a red square around it, indicating it is the currently active or selected application. 

The background is a solid light blue color, creating a clean and minimalistic aesthetic emblematic of macOS design philosophy. The icons to the left of the Finder icon include a mixture of utility, communication, and media applications, all uniformly sized and arranged horizontally. The right side of the dock features additional applications, such as a music player and a browser, along with a Trash icon at the far right. Overall, the image captures the organized and user-friendly nature of the macOS operating system's interface. The Finder icon is highlighted with a red square


︗Accessing the public folder
The owner of the public folder can publish and modify files from a supported machine. External collaborators can only download files published by the owner. 

︗Access as an owner
First, bring up the address bar in macOS Finder by pressing Command + Shift + G.

The image is a screenshot of a macOS Finder window, prominently displaying a high-contrast dark mode interface. At the top of the window, the title "Macintosh HD" is visible, indicating the primary hard drive. The left sidebar shows a navigation menu with various folders such as "Applications," "Library," "System," and "Users," each denoted by a folder icon. The main area of the Finder window features a section labeled "Go to Folder," which is a gray input box where users can type a specific folder path. This box is empty and slightly faded to indicate it's ready for input.

A highlighted message at the bottom of the image, written in bold red font, reads "COMMAND + SHIFT + G," guiding users on how to activate the "Go to Folder" feature. The background is dark, emphasizing the elements within the window and the red text, which stands out against the subdued color scheme. The overall layout reflects a user-friendly interface typical of macOS, illustrating the pathways to access specific folders on the system. Bring up the "go to the folder"
 
In order to access your public folder,
type in the following into the address bar of Finder:

/fs/ftp/pub/<username> - where <username> should be replaced with your username
The image shows a macOS Finder window in dark mode, prominently featuring the title "Macintosh HD" at the top. Below the title, there is a sidebar displaying several folder icons, including "Applications," "Library," "System," and "Users." The main area of the Finder window has a highlighted gray input box labeled "Go to Folder," indicating that users can enter a specific folder path.

It features a rectangular modal dialog with rounded corners, prominently framed in a vibrant red outline, drawing attention to its importance. At the top, there is a labeled input field titled "Server Address," where users can enter the FTP address for connection. Below this field is a section for "Favorite Servers," accompanied by icons for adding or removing favorites. The "Browse" button is located to the right of the server address input, further facilitating user navigation.

The background of the window is primarily dark, enhancing the legibility of the white text and elements within. Below the dialog, in bold red text, is the instruction "COMMAND + K," indicating the keyboard shortcut to open this window. To the left, a sidebar contains "Favorites" such as Users, AirDrop, and others, while the bottom area clearly shows “Macintosh HD” as the currently selected item. This layout exemplifies macOS's intuitive design, making it easy for users to connect to remote servers efficiently. Open the "Connect to Server" window

Then, enter the following address into the server address bar and then click on the "Connect" button.

ftp://ftp.umiacs.umd.edu/pub/<username> - where <username> should be replaced with the desired collaborator's username
The image depicts a macOS "Connect to Server" window, showcasing a streamlined dark mode interface. The window features a rounded rectangular dialog box with a vibrant red outline, emphasizing its importance. At the top, there is a labeled input field marked "Server Address," where users are instructed to enter the FTP address, specifically formatted as "ftp://ftp.umiacs.umd.edu/pub/<username>." The placeholder "<username>" signals users to input their specific usernames.

Beneath the server address field, a section labeled "Favorite Servers" includes icons for managing favorite connections. To the right of the address input, a blue "Browse" button is present, allowing for easier navigation. The window maintains a dark background that enhances the visibility of white text and other elements, creating a clean, user-friendly appearance.

The bottom half of the window displays a directory listing with items categorized as "Folder" under the "Kind" column, indicating that the user is currently navigating through folder structures. This overall layout, consistent with macOS design principles, facilitates efficient server connection management for users. Enter the path to access the public folder

After that you will be prompted with a window where you should choose to connect as a guest and then click "Connect" once more.

The image displays a macOS dialog box for connecting to an FTP server. The interface showcases a dark mode design, which lends a sophisticated, modern aesthetic. At the top of the dialog, there is a prominent title instructing users to enter their name and password for the server "ftp.umiacs.umd.edu." Below the title, a selection labeled "Connect As" features two radio buttons: one for "Guest" highlighted with a red outline and one for "Registered User." This visual designation emphasizes the choice between connecting as a guest or as a registered user.

Below these options, there are labeled input fields for "Name" and "Password," both empty, suggesting user input is necessary. A checkbox option for remembering the password in the keychain is positioned under the password field, indicating a convenience feature for users. The overall background of the dialog is dark, enhancing the contrast of white text and making elements easily legible. At the bottom, there are two buttons: "Cancel" and "Connect," facilitating user navigation tasks. The design adheres to macOS principles of usability and clarity. Select Guest


The image showcases a macOS dialog box designed for connecting to an FTP server, featuring a dark mode interface that enhances readability. At the top, there’s a title instructing users to enter their name and password for the server “ftp.umiacs.edu.” Below the title is the “Connect As” section, which includes two radio buttons. The option for “Guest” is highlighted with a red outline, creating a visual distinction from the “Registered User” option, which remains unhighlighted.

Underneath, there are input fields labeled “Name” and “Password,” both empty, prompting the user to fill in their credentials. A checkbox for remembering the password in the keychain is located below the password field, enhancing user convenience. The background of the dialog is dark gray, which contrasts sharply with the white text and elements, making them easily discernible.

At the bottom of the dialog, two buttons are present: “Cancel” in a subdued style and “Connect” in a blue button encased in a bold red rectangle, drawing focus toward the action the user needs to take.

︗BashForWindows

From UMIACS
(Redirected from BashForWindows10)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Microsoft has partnered with Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, to create a release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows Windows users to use Linux command line tools such as such as grep, sed, git on Windows files through Bash. 

︗Contents

1 Prerequisites
2 Installation
3 Use
4 External Links


︗Prerequisites
In order to install Bash/WSL, you must be running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 version 1607 or later, any version of Windows 11, or Windows Server 2019 or later. In Windows, open the Settings app > System > About to check if your Windows version is compatible. 

︗Installation
First, turn on Developer Mode, open the Settings app > Update & security > For developers > Select the Developer radio button
Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux, this can be done by turning on the feature through the Windows Features program or through a PowerShell session.
For the GUI method: Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off (this will require local administrator privileges > Check the box for Windows Subsystem on Linux
For PowerShell method (in an elevated/administrator session) use the command:  Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux 
Restart the system.
Open a command prompt or PowerShell session, and then run bash.
After accepting the license, the Ubuntu user mode image will be installed.
︗Use
Simply run bash in a command prompt or PowerShell session to enter bash. The first time Bash is installed on Windows, a prompt will appear to create a Unix user. This Unix user account is completely separate from the Windows user account and has  sudo  permissions on the WSL. There is no GUI that is installed, nor can be installed. 

The Linux installation is located at %localappdata%\lxss\, which is a hidden system folder. 

I understand you're looking for detailed descriptions of images related to the "BashForWindows" wiki page, but I currently don't have access to the images you are referencing. If you provide those images, I can help describe them in detail. Please upload the images you'd like described.

Do not use Windows tools to edit the files or sub-files within this directory as corruption of the Linux files could occur.
 Windows storage and files can then be accessed from /mnt/..., such as /mnt/c/Users/myAccount.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Python contains the following information: 






︗Python

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Python(The prior text links to https://www.python.org/) is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.

︗Contents

1 Python Versions
2 Python Environment
3 Installing Modules

3.1 Unix/Linux Alternate Module Installation

3.1.1 'User' scheme
3.1.2 'Prefix' scheme
3.1.3 Python Virtual Environment


3.2 Windows Alternate Module Installation

3.2.1 Prefix Scheme






︗Python Versions
Most modern *NIX distributions ship with a system version of Python.  If the system version is not sufficient, there are multiple versions of Python available via  GNU Modules.  If you find that you need a version of Python that is not currently available through GNU Modules, you can always build it from source(The prior text links to https://www.python.org/downloads/).
If you are using Windows, you can install your required version of Python without Administrator credentials.  Please see the  Windows Python page.

︗Python Environment
Python utilizes a variable called 'PYTHONPATH', which is similar to the PATH variable used in many shells.  The PYTHONPATH variable tells the Python interpreter where to look to find modules.
To view your python path:

bash:~$ python -c 'import sys; print sys.path'
You can add directories to your PYTHONPATH either through your shell, or in your Python code itself:

bash:~$ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/location/to/directory

                 ...or...

>>> sys.path.append('/location/to/directory')
︗Installing Modules
While some of the Versions of Python available in GNU modules provide a default set of modules pre-installed, you may wish to install your own.  Typically you will not have access to the global Python install location, so you will have to install modules using an alternative method.

︗None
︗None
The user scheme allows a user to install the module into the site userbase (python -c 'import site; print site.USER_BASE').  This file location is included in the PYTHONPATH by default.

bash:~$ python setup.py install --user
︗None
The prefix scheme allows a user to install a module into a location of their choice.  Please note: This location will need to be added to the PYTHONPATH in order for the module to be found by the Python interpreter. 

bash:~$ python setup.py install --prefix="/path/to/location"
︗ Python Virtual Environment
A Python Virtual Environment is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects.  For more information on setting up a virtualenv, please see the  Python Virtual Environment page.

︗Windows Alternate Module Installation
︗Prefix Scheme
Python on Windows has a simpler layout, and as such the prefix scheme has traditionally been used to install additional packages into a separate location.

python setup.py install --prefix="\Temp\Python"

Microsoft has partnered with Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, to create a release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows Windows users to use Linux command line tools such as such as grep, sed, git on Windows files through Bash. 

︗Contents

1 Prerequisites
2 Installation
3 Use
4 External Links


︗Prerequisites
In order to install Bash/WSL, you must be running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 version 1607 or later, any version of Windows 11, or Windows Server 2019 or later. In Windows, open the Settings app > System > About to check if your Windows version is compatible. 

︗Installation
First, turn on Developer Mode, open the Settings app > Update & security > For developers > Select the Developer radio button
Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux, this can be done by turning on the feature through the Windows Features program or through a PowerShell session.
For the GUI method: Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off (this will require local administrator privileges > Check the box for Windows Subsystem on Linux
For PowerShell method (in an elevated/administrator session) use the command:  Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux 
Restart the system.
Open a command prompt or PowerShell session, and then run bash.
After accepting the license, the Ubuntu user mode image will be installed.
︗Use
Simply run bash in a command prompt or PowerShell session to enter bash. The first time Bash is installed on Windows, a prompt will appear to create a Unix user. This Unix user account is completely separate from the Windows user account and has  sudo  permissions on the WSL. There is no GUI that is installed, nor can be installed. 

The Linux installation is located at %localappdata%\lxss\, which is a hidden system folder. 

I understand your request, but I don't have any images to describe. If you have images to provide, please upload them, and I'll create detailed descriptions based on their visual content.

Do not use Windows tools to edit the files or sub-files within this directory as corruption of the Linux files could occur.
 Windows storage and files can then be accessed from /mnt/..., such as /mnt/c/Users/myAccount.

Apptainer(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org) is a container platform that doesn't elevate the privileges of a user running the container.  This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus) and doesn't provide administrative control to users on them.  While Docker(The prior text links to https://www.docker.com) is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.
Apptainer was previously branded as Singularity.  You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity, however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.

︗Overview
You can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command.  If this instead says apptainer: command not found and you are using a UMIACS-supported host, please  contact staff and we will ensure that the software is available on the host you are looking for it on.

# apptainer --version
apptainer version 1.2.5-1.el8

Apptainer can run a variety of images including its own format and Docker images(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/docker_and_oci.html).  To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.
If you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory. We suggest you run the following commands to setup alternate cache and tmp directories.  We are using /scratch0 but you can substitute any large enough local scratch directory, network scratch directory, or project directory you would like.

export WORKDIR=/scratch0/$USER
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${WORKDIR}/.cache
export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/.tmp
mkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIR
mkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIR


We do suggest you pull images down into an intermediate file (SIF file) as you then do not have to worry about re-caching the image.

Now you can run the local image with the run command or start a shell with the shell command.  

Please note that if you are in an environment with GPUs and you want to access them inside the container you need to specify the --nv flag. Nvidia has a very specific driver and libraries that are required to run CUDA programs, so this is to ensure that all appropriate devices are created inside the container and that these libraries are made available in the container .

︗Nexus Containers
In our Nexus environment we have some example containers based on our pytorch_docker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker) project.  These can be found in /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch.
You can just run one of the example images by doing the following (you should have already allocated a interactive job with a GPU in Nexus).  It will use the default script(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker/-/blob/master/tensor.py) found at /srv/tensor.py within the image.

$ hostname && nvidia-smi -L

︗Bind Mounts
To get data into the container you need to pass some bind mounts(The prior text links to https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/bind_paths_and_mounts.html).  Apptainer containers will not automatically mount data from the outside operating system other than your home directory.  Users need to manually bind mounts for other file paths.
--bind /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>/<PROJECTNAME>:/mnt
In this example, we will exec an interactive session with GPUs and binding our Nexus scratch directory which allows us to specify the command we want to run inside the container.

apptainer exec --nv --bind /fs/nexus-scratch/username:/fs/nexus-scratch/username /fs/nexus-containers/pytorch/pytorch_1.13.0+cu117.sif bash

You can now write/run your own pytorch python code interactively within the container or just make a python script that you can call directly from the apptainer exec command for batch processing.


︗Shared Containers
Portable images called Singularity Image Format or .sif files can be copied and shared.  Nexus maintains some shared containers in /fs/nexus-containers.  These are arranged by the application(s) that are installed.

︗Docker Workflow Example
We have a pytorch_docker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/pytorch_docker) example workflow using our GitLab as a Docker registry.  You can clone the repository and further customize this to your needs. The workflow is:

Run Docker on a laptop or personal desktop on to create the image, or use Podman on a UMIACS-supported system.
Tag the image and and push it to your repository (this can be any docker registry)
Pull the image down onto one of our workstations/clusters and run it with your data.

︗Podman

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Podman(The prior text links to https://podman.io/) is a daemonless container engine alternative to Docker(The prior text links to https://www.docker.com/).  We don't support Docker in many of our environments as it grants trivial administrative control over the host the Docker daemon runs on.  Podman on the other hand has the ability to run containers in user namespaces.  This means that for every user name space in the kernel you create the processes within it will map to a new uid/gid range.  For example, if you are root in your container, you will not be uid 0 outside the container, but instead you will be uid 4294000000.
We still believe that Apptainer is the best option for running containerized workloads on our clustered based resources.  Podman is a good option for developing the containers to be run via Apptainer or building a deliverable for a funding agency.  Please  contact staff if you would like Podman installed on a workstation or standalone server.  More information on Podman running rootless can be found here(The prior text links to https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md).

︗Contents

1 Getting Started

1.1 Storage


2 GPUs
3 Example


︗Getting Started
To get started there are a few things that you need to configure.
First, run the podman command.  If it says command not found or you get an ERRO like the one below about no subuid ranges, and you are on a workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server, please  contact staff with the error and the host that you are using.  We will need to do some steps to setup the host you want ready.

$ podman
ERRO[0000] cannot find mappings for user username: No subuid ranges found for user "username" in /etc/subuid
Error: missing command 'podman COMMAND'
Try 'podman --help' for more information.

︗Storage
Containers are made up of layers for the image and these are stored in the graphroot setting of ~/.config/containers/storage.conf which by default will be in your home directory.  With our home directories being available over NFS there is an issue(The prior text links to https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs) that due to the user name space mapping described above you will not be able to access your home directory when you are building the layers.
You need to update the graphroot setting to a local directory on the host.  The file ~/.config/containers/storage.conf may not exist until you run podman the first time, however you can manually create it.

[storage]
  driver = "vfs"
  graphroot = "/scratch0/username/.local/share/containers/storage"
...

When building larger images, it may fill up the default directory for imageCopyTmpDir (/var/tmp). If this happens, you will need to specify a different directory using the environment variable TMPDIR. For example:

export TMPDIR="/scratch0/example_tmp_directory"
︗GPUs
Running Podman with the local Nvidia GPUs requires some additional configuration steps that staff has to add to any individual workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server that runs Podman.  This includes ensuring the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed.
For example you can run nvidia-smi from within the official Nvidia CUDA containers with a command like this, optionally replacing the tag for different CUDA versions/OS images:

︗Example
To build your own image you can start from an example we have https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/gpudocker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/gpudocker).
First clone the repository, change directory and build the image with podman.

git clone https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/gpudocker.git
cd gpudocker
podman build -t gpudocker .

Then you can run the test script to verify.  Notice that we pass the local directory test as a path into the image so we can run a script.  This can also be useful for your data output data as well as if you write anywhere else in the container it will not be available outside the container.

$ podman run --volume `pwd`/test:/mnt --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d gpudocker python3 /mnt/test_torch.py

        [0.8574, 0.5116, 0.7021]])

If you instead want to push modifications to this example to your own container registry such that you can pull the container image down later, please see the README.md located in the example repository itself.

Note that in this example, the directory .snapshot could also be .zfs/snapshot depending on the filer serving your host. You can try to ls -l one and if it doesn't exist, try the other.


For this example, the user is logged into host with the username username, and a virtual environment directory named virtualenv exists in the home directory.

username@host:~/virtualenv$ pwd
/nfshomes/username/virtualenv

A Python file named virtualenv.py exists in the directory.

username@host:~/virtualenv$ ls
appveyor.yml      docs         scripts    tox.ini
AUTHORS.txt       LICENSE.txt  setup.cfg  virtualenv_embedded
bin               MANIFEST.in  setup.py   virtualenv.py
CONTRIBUTING.rst  README.rst   tests      virtualenv_support

username@host:~/virtualenv$ ls -lah virtualenv.py
-rwxrwxr-x. 1 username username 98K Jun 12 13:54 virtualenv.py

Remove it from the current working directory.

username@host:~/virtualenv$ rm virtualenv.py

Verify that the file is removed.

username@host:~/virtualenv$ ls
appveyor.yml  CONTRIBUTING.rst  MANIFEST.in  setup.cfg  tox.ini
AUTHORS.txt   docs              README.rst   setup.py   virtualenv_embedded
bin           LICENSE.txt       scripts      tests      virtualenv_support

Change directory into the most recent weekly snapshot.  In this case, it's Weekly_nfshomes_2024-06-23_00:00.

username@host:~/virtualenv$ ls /nfshomes/username/.snapshot
nfshomes_2024-06-25_00:00  nfshomes_2024-06-27_04:00
nfshomes_2024-06-26_00:00  nfshomes_2024-06-27_08:00
nfshomes_2024-06-26_12:00  nfshomes_2024-06-27_12:00
nfshomes_2024-06-26_16:00  Weekly_nfshomes_2024-06-16_00:00
nfshomes_2024-06-26_20:00  Weekly_nfshomes_2024-06-23_00:00
nfshomes_2024-06-27_00:00

username@host:~/virtualenv$ cd /nfshomes/username/.snapshot/Weekly_nfshomes_2024-06-23_00\:00/virtualenv

The file still exists in the snapshot.

username@host:~/.snapshot/Weekly_nfshomes_2024-06-23_00:00/virtualenv$ ls
appveyor.yml      docs         scripts    tox.ini
AUTHORS.txt       LICENSE.txt  setup.cfg  virtualenv_embedded
bin               MANIFEST.in  setup.py   virtualenv.py
CONTRIBUTING.rst  README.rst   tests      virtualenv_support

Copy the file back to the original directory.

username@host:~/.snapshot/Weekly_nfshomes_2024-06-23_00:00/virtualenv$ cp virtualenv.py /nfshomes/username/virtualenv/

Change back to the original directory.

username@host:~/.snapshot/Weekly_nfshomes_2024-06-23_00:00/virtualenv$ cd /nfshomes/username/virtualenv/

Confirm that the file is restored from the snapshot.

username@host:~/virtualenv$ ls
appveyor.yml      docs         scripts    tox.ini
AUTHORS.txt       LICENSE.txt  setup.cfg  virtualenv_embedded

Please provide the images you would like to have described, and I'll create detailed textual descriptions for each one.

As of August 14th 2022, Pulse Secure Client has been rebranded as Ivanti Secure Access Client. Please follow this link for more information on this - Ivanti Secure Access Client.


A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. UMIACS currently provides VPN access through a Ivanti Connect Secure(The prior text links to https://www.ivanti.com/products/connect-secure-vpn) SSL VPN to all users except  class accounts.
Please note that enrollment in our MFA is mandatory to connect using the UMIACS VPN. Enrollment steps can be found  here.

︗Umask

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
umask(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) is the way the UNIX operating system determines what default permissions that files and directories are created with.
With no umask files are created with permissions 666 or 110110110 in binary, and directories are created with permissions 777 or 111111111 in binary.  The umask is represented similarly as three digits, each representing a 3 bits. For each bit that is set to 1 in the umask the corresponding bit of any files or directories that are created is set to 0. In binary operations it is equivelent to bitwise negating the umask and then doing a bitwise and on that negation and the default for the object being created. 
The three popular umasks are 022, 002 and 007.

︗Contents

1 umask 022
2 umask 002
3 umask 007
4 umask 000
5 Setting umask


︗umask 022
This as the example shows above that you will get full rwx for the user, r-x for the group and r-x for other.  This is the default in almost all of our operating systems.

        777  111 111 111
  umask 022  000 010 010   
      = 755  111 101 101

︗umask 002
This would give full rwx for the user, full rwx for the group and give only r-x for other.  This is helpful when you want your default group (or a SetGID directory) to have full control over the files and directories you create while allowing everyone else read and execute permissions.

        777  111 111 111
  umask 002  000 000 010   
      = 775  111 111 101

︗umask 007
This will give the user and group full rwx permissions and give other no permissions.

        777  111 111 111
  umask 007  000 000 111   
      = 770  111 111 000

︗umask 000
Please never use this umask as it will give full control to user, group and other.   In other words it makes the directory or file world read, write and executable and can be a large security risk to you and your colleagues.


︗Setting umask
Your umask is tied to your current shell and can be set with the shell builtin command umask. If issued without an argument the umask will return the current umask, occasionally omitting any leading zeros. To set a umask issue the umask command with umask you want to use.

[gnorts:~] username% umask 
022
[gnorts:~] username% umask 002
[gnorts:~] username% umask
002


However most of the time, you find yourself in a work environment where the same umask is what you want to use all the time, and you don't want to have to think about it. In that you case you want to set your umask in your shell initialization file. For bash the initialization file is .profile or .bash_profile and for tcsh the initialization files is .cshrc or .tcshrc. These files behave mostly like scripts and the umask command can be entered without any additional syntax as seen in the example bellow:

 [username@nexuscfar01 ~]$ cat .cshrc 
 setenv EDITOR vim
 umask 002

Or for example if you use Bash you can run this command.

 echo 'umask 002' >> ~/.bash_profile

6.1 Example
6.2 Available Nodes




︗Overview
UMIACS Class Accounts support classes for all of UMIACS/CSD via the Nexus cluster.  Faculty may request that a class be supported by following the instructions  here.

︗Getting an account
Your TA or instructor will request an account for you. Once this is done, you will be notified by email that you have an account to redeem.  If you have not received an email, please contact your TA or instructor. You must redeem the account within 7 days or else the redemption token will expire.  If your redemption token does expire, please contact your TA or instructor to have it renewed.
Once you do redeem your account, you will need to wait until you get a confirmation email that your account has been installed.  This is typically done once a day on days that the University is open for business.
Any questions or issues with your account, storage, or cluster use must first be made through your TA or instructor.

︗Registering for Duo
UMIACS requires that all Class accounts register for MFA (multi-factor authentication) under our Duo instance (note that this is different than UMD's general Duo instance). You will not be able to log onto the class submission host until you register.
If you see the following error in your SSH client, you have not yet enrolled/registered in Duo.

Access is not allowed because you are not enrolled in Duo. Please contact your organization's IT help desk.

In order to register, visit our directory app(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory) and log in with your Class username and password. You will then receive a prompt to enroll in Duo. For assistance in enrollment, please visit our  Duo help page.
Once notified that your account has been installed and you have registered in our Duo instance, you can SSH to nexusclass.umiacs.umd.edu with your assigned username and your chosen password to log in to a submission host.
If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:

nexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edu
nexusclass01.umiacs.umd.edu
︗Cleaning up your account before the end of the semester
Class accounts for a given semester are liable to be archived and deleted after that semester's completion as early as the following:

Winter semesters: February 1st of same year
Spring semesters: June 1st of same year
Summer semesters: September 1st of same year
Fall semesters: January 1st of next year
It is your responsibility to ensure you have backed up anything you want to keep from your class account's personal or group storage (below sections) prior to the relevant date.

︗Personal Storage
Your home directory has a quota of 30GB and is located at:

/fs/classhomes/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>

where <semester> is either "spring", "summer", "fall", or "winter", <year> is the current year e.g., "2021",  <coursecode> is the class' course code as listed in UMD's Schedule of Classes(The prior text links to https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/) in all lowercase e.g., "cmsc999z", and <username> is the username mentioned in the email you received to redeem the account e.g., "c999z000".
You can request up to another 100GB of personal storage if you would like by having your TA or instructor  contact staff. This storage will be located at

/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>

︗Group Storage
You can also request group storage by having your TA or instructor  contact staff to specify the usernames of the accounts that should be in the group. Only other class accounts in the same class can be added to the group. The quota will be 100GB multiplied by the number of accounts in the group and will be located at

/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<groupname>

where <groupname> is composed of:

the abbreviated course code as used in the username e.g., "c999z"
the character "g"
the number of the group (starting at 0 for the first group for the class requested to us) prepended with 0s to make the total group name 8 characters long
e.g., "c999zg00".

︗Cluster Usage
You may not run computational jobs on any submission host.  You must  schedule your jobs with the SLURM workload manager.  You can also find out more with the public documentation for the SLURM Workload Manager(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html).
Class accounts only have access to the following submission parameters in SLURM:

--partition - class
--account - class
--qos - default, medium, and high
You must specify at least the partition parameter manually in any submission command you run. If you do not specify any QoS parameter, you will receive the QoS default.
You can view the resource limits for each QoS by running the command show_qos. The value in the MaxWall column is the maximum runtime you can run a single job for each QoS, and the values in the MaxTRES column are the maximum amount of CPU cores/GPUs/memory you can request for a single job using each QoS.
Please note that you will be restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM across all jobs you have running at once. This can be viewed with the command show_partition_qos.

︗Example
Here is a basic example to schedule a interactive job running bash with a single GPU in the partition class, with the account class, running with the QoS of default and the default CPU/memory allocation/time limit for the partition.

bash-4.4$ hostname
nexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edu

bash-4.4$ srun --partition=class --account=class --qos=default --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash
srun: Job time limit was unset; set to partition default of 60 minutes
srun: job 1333337 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 1333337 has been allocated resources

bash-4.4$ hostname
tron14.umiacs.umd.edu

bash-4.4$ nvidia-smi -L
GPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-55f2d3b7-9162-8b02-50de-476a012c626c)

︗Available Nodes
You can list the available nodes and their current state with the show_nodes -p class command.  This list of nodes is not completely static as nodes may be pulled out of service to repair/replace GPUs or other components.

To visit your spam quarantine, log in to the system using any of our firewalls using your UMIACS email address (username@umiacs.umd.edu) and password:
bubs.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://bubs.umiacs.umd.edu)
pompom.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://pompom.umiacs.umd.edu)
From this you will see a drop-down box that says "select filter" (see picture below)
The image displays a user interface for the Barracuda Email Security Gateway, specifically focusing on the "Quarantine Inbox" section. At the top, there are tabs labeled "Quarantine Inbox" and "Preferences," with a prominent "Sign out" option in the upper right corner. Below these tabs, a dropdown menu is visible, labeled "Subject" with an adjacent button that reads "Apply Filter." This allows users to specify search criteria for quarantined emails.

A gray banner indicates a warning: "Messages older than 21 days will be removed," suggesting a time limit for emails in quarantine. The main section lists quarantined messages in a table format. Rows display several columns like "Time Received," "From," "Subject," and "Actions." The "From" column shows email addresses, while many "Subject" entries are obscured by black bars, likely indicating sensitive information. In the "Actions" column, buttons for “Deliver,” “Whitelist,” and “Delete” allow users to manage the emails. The visual layout features a clean design with a blue and gray color scheme, promoting ease of navigation while managing quarantined messages.
There are three different filters, "from", "subject", and "message". "From" will allow you to search the emails based on who sent them. "Subject" will allow you to search based on the subject of emails. Message will allow you to search in the body of the email. To the right of the filter, you can either select "contains" or "doesn't contain". This will tell the filter to check if something contains the text you search for or doesn't contain the text you search for. For example if your filter is "subject" and you select "contains" and search for "binary" this will be the result.
The image depicts a user interface for the Barracuda Email Security Gateway, specifically the "Quarantine Inbox" section. At the top are navigation tabs labeled "Quarantine Inbox" and "Preferences," with a prominent "Sign out" link in the upper right corner. Below these tabs, there is a filtering dropdown labeled "Subject," accompanied by options that allow users to specify conditions such as "contains" or "doesn't contain." Next to this is an "Apply Filter" button.

A gray warning banner above the email listings alerts users that "Messages older than 21 days will be removed," emphasizing a retention policy for quarantined emails. The main area of the interface showcases a table with columns titled "Time Received," "From," "Subject," and "Actions." Each row represents a quarantined email, with the "From" column displaying the sender's email address and the "Subject" column obscured by black bars, likely to protect sensitive information. The “Actions” column features buttons labeled “Deliver,” “Whitelist,” and “Delete,” allowing users to manage their quarantined messages more effectively. The color scheme is primarily blue and gray, contributing to a clean, professional appearance.
If your filter is "subject" and you select "doesn't contain" "binary", all of the emails that don't have "binary" in the subject will be shown.

︗InputMethodEditors

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Input method editors or IMEs make it easier to type in languages (usually but not limited to East Asian ones) that are made up of thousands of characters that can't fit on a standard keyboard

︗Adding an IME
IMEs are a per user setting and can be added/removed/customized without any need for administrative privileges. To add an IME to your account please follow these instructions.

Click the Windows button and open the control panel. The image displays a Windows operating system interface, specifically the Start menu against a bright blue desktop background. It captures a portion of the Taskbar with various icons visible, including applications like "VLC media player," "Sticky Notes," and "Snipping Tool," indicating common programs that users might access quickly.

︗EnvironmentalVariables

From UMIACS

In UNIX and Windows many of the commands run have variables that are parsed from a user's environment.

︗None
The most common variable is the PATH variable, which will add additional paths to search for programs to be run from the command line. These can be set in many ways but we will cover the most popular: tcsh and bash. You can see your PATH variable by using the built-in echo command in the shell.  When printing out environment variables you will need to prefix the variable with the $ sign.

$ echo $PATH
/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

In almost all cases you will want to append to either the beginning or end of your PATH variable and not replace it fully as this will most likely decrease the functionality of your shell.  For example, if you wanted to add the path /opt/UMtorque/bin to the end of your PATH then you could do the following,

tcsh/csh
setenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin
bash/sh
export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin
These can be either typed into your shell directly or added to your shell's initialization files so every time you spawn a shell it will get this new PATH.

︗None
To modify the Windows PATH Environmental Variable do the following: 

Go to Control Panel and click on User Accounts. Then click on the User Accounts heading within User Accounts.
On the left pane, click Change my environment variables.
Under User Variables for <username> choose the PATH variable.
If there is none, click New and put PATH for the Variable name.
Click Edit and append the location you are trying to add. Different paths are separated by semicolons.
To verify that the PATH variable has been modified properly do the following:

Open a new Command Prompt (Start -> Accessories -> Command Prompt).
Type in PATH.
The updated PATH should be printed.

UMIACS has 2 types of mailing lists, simple ones in our LDAP (also known as mailaliases) and Mailman mailing lists. Please contact the HelpDesk if you would like either of these types of mailing lists created.

︗Mailaliases
These are simple Email redirects that allow for <listnamehere>@umiacs.umd.edu to be forwarded to a set list of email addresses. This is ideal for situations where you have a set number of addresses in mind (i.e. no membership changes) and do not need to do any other moderation on the list.

︗Mailman
These are more complicated lists that have a robust set of administrative tools:

︗Setting File Permissions in Windows

From UMIACS
(Redirected from WindowsPermissions)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
︗None
Right-click the file or directory you would like to change permissions for and click on 'Properties.'
In this example: We will be changing the permissions of a Folder named "ExampleFolder", which is owned by "GenericUser" but has granted permissions to another user, named "Example". We will be looking at these permissions.
After the properties menu comes up, select the tab labeled 'Security'.
The image displays a Windows file properties dialog box titled “ExampleFolder Properties.” At the top, the path indicates that the folder is located at "C:\Users\GenericUser\Documents\ExampleFolder." The window features four main tabs: General, Sharing, Security, and Previous Versions. 

In the "Security" tab, the "Group or user names" section lists four users/groups: SYSTEM, GenericUser (identified by the PC's name as a part of a longer identifier), Example, and Administrators. Each user/group has corresponding permissions displayed in a grid format. 

The permissions for SYSTEM include "Full control," "Modify," "Read & execute," "List folder contents," "Read," and "Write," with checkmarks indicating allowed permissions. A gray checkbox under "Full control" signifies the default permission status. 

At the bottom of the dialog, users can see buttons labeled "Edit," "OK," "Cancel," and "Apply." An "Advanced" link is also present for accessing more detailed permissions settings. The overall interface is characteristic of Windows 10, emphasizing clarity and accessibility for user interaction with folder permissions.
Click on the button at the bottom of the menu labeled 'Advanced'.
The image displays the "Advanced Security Settings" dialog box for a folder named "ExampleFolder" located at "C:\Users\GenericUser\Documents\ExampleFolder." The top portion includes the folder's name, the owner's name (GenericUser), and a link to change ownership. Below, there are tabs labeled "Permissions," "Auditing," and "Effective Access." 

In the central section, a table lists four entries detailing user permissions. Each entry includes the following columns: Type, Principal, Access, Inherited from, and Applies to. 

The users listed are: 
1. Example, with "Full control" access.
2. SYSTEM, also with "Full control."
3. Administrators, with "Full control."
4. GenericUser, again with "Full control."

The "Inherited from" column indicates where permissions originate for each. An option to "Edit" is available for modifying permission settings, alongside buttons to add or remove users and settings for disabling inheritance. 

At the bottom, the dialog includes buttons labeled "OK," "Cancel," "Apply," and a checkbox option to replace child permissions, emphasizing user-focused adjustments to folder security settings. The interface follows the standard design of Windows applications, with a clear, structured layout for ease of use.
Select the user that you would like to change permissions for, and select "Edit". In this case: We are changing the permissions of the user named "Example".
The image titled "Permission Entry for ExampleFolder" displays a Windows dialog box used for setting permissions on a folder named "ExampleFolder." At the top, the principal is identified as "Example (DESKTOP-D0L8R09\Example)," and it specifies that permissions are being modified for "This folder, subfolders, and files." 

In the central section, there is a grid labeled "Basic permissions," which includes various checkboxes representing different permissions that can be assigned. The permissions listed are "Full control," "Modify," "Read & execute," "List folder contents," "Read," and "Write." All permissions except for "Special permissions" are checked, indicating they are allowed for the specified principal. 

To the right, there is an option labeled "Show advanced permissions," allowing for more detailed settings. At the bottom, there is a checkbox that, when selected, would restrict these permissions to only the objects or containers within the current folder. The dialog includes buttons at the bottom for "OK," "Clear all," and "Cancel," allowing users to apply or dismiss changes. The overall interface is reflective of the Windows 10 aesthetic, with a clear and straightforward layout for user-friendly interaction.
Select the permissions you would like this user to have. To view more granular permissions, Select "Show Advanced permissions".
The image titled "Permission Entry for ExampleFolder" shows a Windows dialog box used to modify folder permissions. At the top, the principal is labeled as "Example (DESKTOP-D0L8R09\Example)" and the type indicates "Allow." This dialog is specifically for permissions on "This folder, subfolders, and files." 

The central area features a grid under "Advanced permissions," with multiple checkboxes representing different permissions. The permissions include "Full control," "Traverse folder / execute file," "List folder / read data," "Read attributes," and more, with the respective boxes checked for permissions granted. To the right, additional permission options are displayed, including "Write attributes" and "Delete," most of which are unchecked.

A checkbox at the bottom allows the user to restrict permissions to only the current folder's contents. The buttons "OK," "Clear all," and "Cancel" are positioned at the bottom right, facilitating user interaction with the permission settings. The design reflects a standard Windows 10 aesthetic, emphasizing usability and clarity for adjusting folder security settings.
Apply or deny permissions for each user which needs to be updated.
Apply all changes by clicking the 'OK' or 'Apply' button at the bottom of each menu as necessary.

1 Quotas

1.1 RPC Quotas
1.2 Tree Quotas


2 Calculating Space Usage


︗Quotas
︗RPC Quotas
File systems that support RPC quotad quotas are reported to the user by the quota command.  Home directories that are mounted from our Isilon NAS will support these kinds of quotas.
To find out what your current quota is, first run df . to find out what file system you are currently mounted from (in this example it is  data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username). Please note that the Use% here is for the entire file system and not your user-specific home directory.

# df .
Filesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on
data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/username

Then run quota and that line will list your quota information for that file system.  If you see errors such as "Error while getting quota from ..." you may safely ignore these as some of our file systems do not report quotas correctly.

$ quota
Disk quotas for user username (uid 13337):
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username
                     24  5138024 5242880              10  10276045 10485760

If you have hit your RPC quota and haven't realized it, you may see some strange issues. For example, you will not be able to write-out files (although 'touch' and file concatenation will succeed). Some applications such as vi will throw "FSync" errors. Similarly, commands such as wget will appear to succeed but your files will be zero-length.

︗Tree Quotas
An alternate style of quota management is done through tree quotas that show up in how much space is available in the file system by using the df command to inspect either the current path (no arguments given) or a given path.
For example to show my /nfshomes/username home directory quota, I can just use df ~

$ df ~
Filesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on
data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/username

︗Calculating Space Usage
When you are looking to diagnose how much space you are using you often want to know how much storage the immediate directories are taking in a certain folder.  The utility to do this is du.  Since *NIX operating systems use the concept of .. for the previous directory simple file globs like .* don't provide exactly what you need since in certain places like your home directories there are a lot of dot files or hidden files (eg. .somename).  To identify all files and directories from the current directory you can use something like du -hs .[^.]* *.

-bash-4.2$ du -hs .[^.]* *
48K     .bash_history
94M     .cache
160K    .compiz

︗WebSpace

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
UMIACS provides static web space hosting for research/lab pages and user pages.

︗Contents

1 Hosting websites in UMIACS Object Store (preferred method)
2 Main Website and Lab Pages
3 Personal Web Space

3.1 UMIACS Object Store
3.2 Nexus File Space


4 Adding A Password Protected Folder To Your Web Space
5 Restricting Content based on IP address


︗None
Please refer to the section "Hosting a Website in your Bucket" on the UMIACS Object Store Help Page(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help) or visit OBJ/WebHosting. This is currently our most updated and reliable method for hosting websites.

︗Main Website and Lab Pages
http://www.umiacs.umd.edu
You can access the main website and lab sites for editing in two ways:

From Unix as /fs/www - and can be remotely accessed by SFTP to a supported Unix host (eg. Nexus).
From Windows as \\umiacs-webftp\www-umiacs - and remotely accessed by the same file share over the VPN.
Faculty members and authorized users can modify their own public profiles on the main UMIACS homepage. For instructions, see ContentManagement.

︗Personal Web Space
Your personal website URL at UMIACS is

http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~username
where username is your UMIACS username.  You can set this page to redirect to any page of your choice by setting the Home Page attribute in your UMIACS directory entry(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/info/).
In general, large files or directories for distribution related to a lab's research should go into the specific lab's web tree, not your individual web tree.  Remember that your webpage is not permanently continued upon your departure from UMIACS.
UMIACS currently supports hosting a personal website on the Object Store.

︗UMIACS Object Store
This is the preferred method of hosting a personal website at UMIACS. Please see the UMIACS Object Store (OBJ) Help Page(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help) for more information on creating a website within OBJ. Once you create your website in OBJ, you will need to set your directory Home Page to the bucket's URL (the URL that ends in umiacs.io).

︗Nexus File Space


Please provide the images from the wiki, and I will generate detailed textual descriptions for each one.

This service has been deprecated.

This is primarily a legacy method for users who already have their websites configured this way. If you believe that your circumstances require your personal website to be hosted on this file space, please contact the  Help Desk. (This does not affect existing users who already have websites hosted on the Nexus file space.)
You will need set your directory Home Page attribute to http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~username(The prior text links to http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~username), where username is your UMIACS username (similar to your personal URL above). You can access your website for editing in two ways:

From Unix as /fs/www-users/username - and can be remotely accessed via SFTP to a supported UNIX host.
From Windows as \\umiacs-webftp\www-users\username - and remotely accessed by the same file share over the VPN.
︗Adding A Password Protected Folder To Your Web Space


Please provide the images from the wiki, and I will generate detailed textual descriptions for each one.

This method will NOT work in the UMIACS Object Store.

1) Create the directory you want to password protect or cd into the directory you want to password protect.
2) Create a file called .htaccess ( vi .htaccess) in the directory you wish to password protect.
3) In the file you just created, type the following lines 

AuthUserFile "/your/directory/here/".htpasswd
AuthName "Secure Document"
AuthType Basic
require user username

For example, if you were going to protect the /fs/www-users/username/private directory and you want the required name to be class239, then your file would look like this:

AuthUserFile /fs/www-users/username/private/.htpasswd
AuthName "Secure Document"
AuthType Basic
require user class239

4) Create a file called .htpasswd in the same directory as .htaccess. You create this file by typing in htpasswd -c .htpasswd username in the directory area to be protected.
In the example above, the username is class239 so you would type htpasswd -c .htpasswd class239
You will be prompted to enter the password you want. The .htpasswd file will be created in the current directory and will contain an encrypted version of the password.
To later change the username, edit the .htaccess file and change the username. If you want to later change the password, just retype the above line in step 4 and enter the new password at the prompt.

︗Restricting Content based on IP address
It is possible to have pages on your webspace only accessible to clients connecting from certain IP addresses. In order to accomplish this, cd in to the directory you wish to restrict, and edit your .htaccess or httpd.conf file. The example below shows how to make content only viewable to clients connecting from the UMD WiFi in Apache 2.2.

SetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For "^128\.8\.\d+\.\d+$" UMD_NETWORK
SetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For "^129\.2\.\d+\.\d+$" UMD_NETWORK
SetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For "^192\.168\.\d+\.\d+$" UMD_NETWORK
SetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For "^206\.196\.(?:1[6-9][0-9]|2[0-5][0-9])\.\d+$" UMD_NETWORK
SetEnvIF X-Forwarded-For "^10\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$" UMD_NETWORK
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from env=UMD_NETWORK

The SetEnvIF directive will modify one's environment if the specified attribute matches the provided regular expression. In this example, IP addresses that are forwarded from an IP within UMD's IP space are tagged with UMD_NETWORK. Then, all traffic to the example directory is blocked unless it has the UMD_NETWORK tag. See the following pages for a more in depth explanation of the commands used.
.htaccess(The prior text links to https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/htaccess.html), SetEnvIf(The prior text links to https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_setenvif.html#setenvif), Order(The prior text links to https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#order), Deny(The prior text links to https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#deny), Allow(The prior text links to https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#allow)

︗UMIACS Object Store
An object store is a web-based storage solution focused on reliability, scalability and security. It is best suited for public content storage/distribution, archiving data or secure data sharing between users. Our Object Store can be used through the web interface(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj), the command line UMobj utilities, third-party graphical  clients, and even programmatically using many popular programming languages.  We support a subset of the Amazon Simple Storage Services (S3) API(The prior text links to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), built around a technology called Ceph(The prior text links to http://ceph.com/).

︗Terminology
S3-like storage thinks in terms of buckets and keys. Keys are analogous to files. A bucket is simply a container to a set of keys. There is no actual hierarchy inside of a bucket, but the standard UNIX path separator, a forward slash (/) at the end of a Key name, is interpreted by many clients (including this web site and our UMobj utilities) as being a directory delimiter. This allows you to copy data from your local filesystems to your buckets through umobj or third-party clients. You may specify who has what types of access to your buckets via Access Control Lists (ACLs) at the bucket level or the individual key level.
Your data is protected from individual machine failure via replication within the cluster. All data is checksummed in accordance with the Amazon S3 protocol to ensure that data in transit is valid before it is accepted by the cluster. However, there are no backups or snapshots of this data in the cluster, so if a user deletes a key or bucket in the Object Store, there is no way to restore that information.

︗Getting Started
UMIACS users are allocated 50GB of storage.  Faculty are allocated 10TB. To get started, log in(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj) and you will be redirected to the initial help page.  You can also find the link from our https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu) site as "OBJbox Object Store".

︗Buckets
You can create and browse your buckets (containers that hold data) by visiting your buckets(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/) page. You can also set bucket-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) from this page. Bucket-level ACLs get implicitly inherited to all the keys within the bucket. However, individual keys can have additional specific ACLs applied for more granular control.
Bucket names must be unique. When you create a bucket it will notify you if the name is already taken.

︗None
After selecting a bucket, you will be able to create folders and upload files within that bucket. Listed files can be downloaded, deleted, or assigned a specific ACL by the key owner/creator.
Please note: Local file system ownership and permissions, and special files (such as symlinks) can not be represented in the Object Store. We highly suggest that if you are securing data into the Object Store and need these to be faithfully maintained that you use a local archive tool (tar, zip, etc..) to collect the data and then upload the resulting archive file(s).

︗Hosting a Website in your Bucket
Please visit OBJ/WebHosting for more information.

︗None
Within the web interface you can delete files one-by-one. If you want to remove a bunch of files, you will need to use a different client as described below.
This is dangerous as there are no backups of files in the Object Store. Be careful to only delete the data you intend to delete.

︗Clients
There are several clients that can be used (sometimes with a limited set of features) on your desktop to gain access to the Object Store. All supported UMIACS systems running RHEL8 have a copy of our UMobj(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj) utilities preinstalled which provide command line access to the Object Store. We also have an article in our wiki on  third party clients that lists and explains the details. These clients need to be configured with your Access and Secret Keys as described below.

︗Access Key and Secret Key
Each user has one or more pairs of Access Keys and Secret Keys that are used as a credential to not expose your password when using the Object Store. These can be obtained by clicking on your username(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/user/) in the upper right-hand corner. You'll use these to identify and authenticate yourself to the Object Store.
Please treat your Secret Key(s) the same as a password and do not plaintext it over email/otherwise or share it with any other individuals.
When using the umobj(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj) utilities, you will need to make sure you have added these credentials in your local shell initialization files. There are links to files that have these automatically generated for the 3 most popular UNIX shell families (bash/sh, csh/tcsh, and zsh). Please make sure that whatever file(s) you copy these credentials into can not be read by other users (eg. chmod 600 filename).
Note: Each Access Key and Secret Key are specific to a particular object store, so if you are accessing multiple object stores you may want to write the credentials for each to separate files and then source each file when you want to use the associated object store. Please  contact staff if you have any questions.

︗LabGroups
LabGroups allow a group of users to share data while avoiding the need for complex ACLs by maintaining group ownership. Designated LabGroup managers can grant granular access (read, write, full control, manager) to buckets owned by the LabGroup. All objects owned by a LabGroup count against the group quota. LabGroups can be navigated using the menu with username in the top right corner of the page. Note: this will only appear if you are a member of at least one LabGroup. At this point, you can browse the Object Store as the LabGroup and obtain your unique Access Key and Secret Key pair using the instructions above. To switch to another LabGroup or back to your own buckets, click the menu again and select another user or group.

︗Managing LabGroups
LabGroups have many different levels of membership: Managers, FULL_CONTROL, READ/WRITE, and READ. Managers can add or remove LabGroup Members while every other access level cannot. If you hold the Manager role in a LabGroup, you can add and remove users using the Manage LabGroups(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/labgroup/list/) page, which is available under the Manage menu at the top of the page. After selecting a LabGroup, you can add users by typing their username into the search field and selecting a membership role.

︗Requesting a LabGroup
To request a LabGroup for your project, please  contact staff.

Python can be user installed.
Below are installation instructions for both .exe and MSI installers. MSI installers have been discontinued for Python version 3.5 and above. 

︗Contents

1 Installing Python via .exe
2 Installing Python via MSI
3 Installing Modules

3.1 Using an executable
3.2 Using python
3.3 Using easy_install


4 Popular Executable Modules


︗Installing Python via .exe
Download Python application of the version you want from here(The prior text links to https://www.python.org/download/). Note that there are options for the 32-bit or 64-bit version, but you might need to do some searching.
Click run, to run the installer.
The image depicts a pop-up window from a Windows operating system, typically encountered during the download of executable files. The window features a light yellow background with rounded corners, prominently displaying a message that reads, "Do you want to run or save python-3.5.2-amd64.exe (28.7 MB) from python.org?" This indicates that a user has attempted to download the Python installer, specifically a 64-bit version of Python 3.5.2. Below the message, there is a warning stating, "This type of file could harm your computer," alerting the user about potential risks associated with executable files.

The pop-up includes three buttons at the bottom: "Run," "Save," and "Cancel," providing the user with options to either execute, store the file on their device, or abort the process. The button "Save" has a drop-down arrow, suggesting additional options might be available when clicked. The overall layout is structured and straightforward, consistent with standard dialog boxes in the Windows environment, focusing on user safety and decision-making regarding file downloads.
Select Install Now. Make sure that you uncheck the "Install launcher for all users" box. Leaving this checked will cause the installation to fail.
The image depicts the installation interface for Python 3.5.2 (64-bit) on a Windows operating system. The window has a predominantly white background with a yellow-and-blue logo of the Python language in the lower left corner. At the top, prominently labeled, is "Python 3.5.2 (64-bit) Setup." 

Central to the interface is a message instructing users to select "Install Now" to install Python with default settings or choose "Customize" to adjust installation features. Below this, the path for the default installation is displayed: “C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35,” indicating where Python will be stored. 

To the left of the "Install Now" button, which is highlighted, there's an icon resembling a checklist. Additionally, users can customize installation options, indicated by a button labeled "Customize installation."

Check boxes are present beneath the main options for installing the launcher for all users and adding Python 3.5 to the system PATH, although both options are unchecked. The interface is user-friendly and clean, designed for straightforward installation. The window includes a Cancel button at the bottom right, allowing users to exit the setup.
Finish the installation here(The prior text links to https://www.python.org/download/).
This installer will automatically allow you to access Python from the command line by just typing py instead of the full path.

︗Installing Python via MSI
Download Python windows MSI installer from here(The prior text links to https://www.python.org/download/). Note that there are options for the 32-bit or 64-bit version, but you might need to do some searching.
Click run, to run the installer.
The image displays a pop-up window typical of the Windows operating system, presenting the user with a prompt concerning a file download. The window features a light yellow background with rounded corners, indicating user-facing design. At the center is a message asking, "Do you want to run or save python-2.7.12.msi (18.0 MB) from python.org?" This message highlights that the user is downloading the Python installer for version 2.7.12. Below this is a cautionary note stating, "This type of file could harm your computer," serving as a warning about the potential risks associated with executing installer files.

The dialog box provides three interactive buttons at the bottom: "Run," "Save," and "Cancel." The "Run" button suggests executing the installer immediately, while "Save" allows the user to store the file on their device, and "Cancel" aborts the download process. The "Save" button features a drop-down arrow, indicating additional saving options. This interface emphasizes user safety and clarity, offering straightforward choices regarding managing downloaded executable files in a Windows environment.
Select a home directory as the install folder (i.e.C:\Users\[YOURUSERNAME]\Documents\Pythonx.x.x)  where x represents the version number.
The image displays the setup interface for Python version 2.7.12 on a Windows operating system. The window features a clean, light gray background with a prominent Python logo—a blue and yellow stylized snake—positioned at the top left. At the top of the window is the title "Python 2.7.12 Setup." 

Central to the display is a message prompting the user to "Select Destination Directory," directing them to choose a folder for the installation files. To facilitate this, there are navigational buttons: a "Documents" shortcut to quickly access the documents folder, an "Up" button to navigate to the previous directory, and a "New" button to create a new directory. 

The area below this message showcases the current selected path, indicating "C:\Users\aberi\Documents\Python2.7," accompanied by an empty selection box for users to visually navigate through available directories. 

At the bottom of the window, standard navigation buttons are displayed: "Back," "Next," and "Cancel," allowing users to either return to the previous step, proceed to the next, or terminate the setup process. The overall design prioritizes user-friendliness, with intuitive options for directory selection.
Finish the installation.
If you want to be able to access Python from the command line by just typing python instead of the full path (i.e. \temp\pythonfolder\python) you have to add the python folder to your path.

Navigate to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System
Select Advanced system settings from the sidebar
In the Advanced tab click the Environment Variables... button
Check if a Variable called Path exists in the list of user variables
If it exists, add the python directory to the end of the Path value separated by a semicolon (i.e. C:\Things\In\Path;C:\Path\To\Python\Folder)
If it does not, press the New button and set the variable name to Path and the value to the path to your python directory


︗Installing Modules
︗Using an executable
Alternatively, python executable modules can be found on the web, and the executable installed

︗Using python
Modules can be installed as the normally would using python.
For instance if the python directory is in your path you merely navigate to the module directory and run:

python setup.py install

︗Using easy_install
These steps assume that Visual Studio is installed (It is by default)
First, we configure python to work with Visual Studio

Open the file msvc9compiler.py  from  the location C:\Path\To\Python\Folder\...\Lib\distutils\msvc9compiler.py  using a text editor such as notepad
Replace the line containing toolskey = "VS%0.f0COMNTOOLS" % version  with the following toolskey = "vs110COMNTOOLS" , where 110 is a three digit number corresponding to the version number of Visual Studio 2012
To do this, type  Ctr + a  to highlight all the text, and type  Ctrl + f  to search for the line to be replaced, and edit the file to replace it
Also replace the line containing  mfinfo = self.manifest_get_embed_info(target_desc, Id_args)  with the line:  mfinfo = None 
Next we install the module

Download the easy_install graphical installer from here(The prior text links to https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py)
Run the downloaded file, it should open a command line and finish the installation
The installed files should be located in  C:\Path\To\Python\Folder\..\Scripts
There are several different python modules, so note the name of the module you want to install. numPy will be installed here.
Open a command prompt, by pressing the start button, and searching  cmd  
The image displays a search interface from the Windows 7 operating system, likely the Start menu. The screen features a pale blue background with the default Windows wallpaper, including light clouds and a green hill. A search box at the top labeled "Search programs and files" contains the text "cmd," indicating the user is searching for the command prompt application.

Below the search box, results are categorized into three sections: "Programs," "Documents," and "Files." The "Programs" section shows one entry labeled "cmd," which likely refers to the Command Prompt application. In the "Documents" section, there are eleven entries, including various files associated with Python scripts, such as "cmd.cython-34," "test_cmd_line_script," and "test_config_cmd." The entries are listed with accompanying icons, making it clear they are documents.

The "Files" section includes a reference to "setuptools-3.5.1," exemplifying related installation files. The interface allows users to easily navigate and select files or programs from their computer, enhancing efficiency in accessing applications within the Windows environment. The bottom of the screen features the "Log off" button, signifying a user-friendly layout.
At the prompt, type the full path to easy_install executable and the name of the python module you need. ie.  C:\Path\To\Python\Folder\..\Scripts\easy_install.exe module_Name
where module_Name is the name of the module, numPy in this case
The image depicts a Windows Command Prompt interface on a computer running Windows 7. The window features a dark background with white text, showing command-line outputs. At the top, it displays "Administrator: C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe," indicating that the user is operating with administrative privileges. Below this, a command line shows the path "C:\Users\Mfango\Documents\Python3.4.1\Scripts\easy_install.exe," suggesting that the user is navigating to execute the `easy_install` program, a tool for installing Python modules.

The command prompt entry, "easy_install numPy," indicates that the user is attempting to install the Python module named NumPy. However, the line that follows states, "No urls, filenames, or requirements specified (see -h for help)," suggesting an error or oversight in the command input, possibly due to missing parameters or incorrect syntax. The overall interface clearly communicates a context for command line operations and the installation of Python packages, typical for users managing Python environments or troubleshooting installation issues. The visual layout, featuring bordered sections of text against a solid background, is characteristic of command-line interfaces in Windows systems.

︗Nexus/CML

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The compute nodes from CML's previous standalone cluster have folded into Nexus as of the scheduled  maintenance window for August 2023 (Thursday 08/17/2023, 5-8pm).
The Nexus cluster already has a large pool of compute resources made possible through college-level funding for UMIACS and CSD faculty. Details on common nodes already in the cluster (Tron partition) can be found  here.
Please  contact staff with any questions or concerns.

︗Contents

1 Usage
2 Partitions
3 Accounts
4 QoS
5 Storage

5.1 Home Directories
5.2 Project Directories
5.3 Scratch Directories

5.3.1 Network Scratch Directory
5.3.2 Local Scratch Directories


5.4 Datasets
5.5 Models




︗Usage
You can SSH to nexuscml.umiacs.umd.edu to log in to a submission host.
If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:

nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu
nexuscml01.umiacs.umd.edu
All partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone CML cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that cml- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone CML cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named cml in the standalone cluster (it is also named just cml in Nexus).
Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:



Standalone CML cluster submission command

Nexus cluster submission command


srun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash

srun --partition=cml-dpart --qos=cml-medium --account=cml-tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bash


srun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash

srun --partition=cml-cpu --qos=cml-cpu --account=cml --pty bash


srun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash

srun --partition=cml-scavenger --qos=cml-scavenger --account=cml-scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash

CML users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on CML nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the cml-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all cml## nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named cml.
Please note that the CML compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. CML users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the cml-scavenger partition (i.e., all cml- partition jobs (other than cml-scavenger) can preempt both cml-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and cml-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).

︗Partitions
There are three partitions available to general CML SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.

cml-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed.
cml-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other cml- partitions are ready to be scheduled.
cml-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.
There are two additional partitions available solely to specific faculty members and their sponsored accounts.

cml-furongh - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Furong Huang's purchased A6000 node. Job allocations are guaranteed.
cml-zhou - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Tianyi Zhou's purchased nodes. Job allocations are guaranteed.
︗Accounts
The Center has a base SLURM account cml which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in the cluster have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster, which provides a number of guaranteed billing resources corresponding to the amount that they invested.
If you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the cml account, which only has access to the cml-cpu, cml-default, and cml-medium QoSes (see below section).
If you need access to a different QoS, or if the cml account is at its billing limit (see below in this section), please use your faculty sponsor's account if they have one available. However, keep in mind that if you use your faculty sponsor has their own named partition (see previous section), using the faculty-specific account in the cml-dpart partition may block access to resources in the faculty-specific partition, since the billing limit for the account is charged regardless of what partition is being used.
The current faculty accounts are:

cml-abhinav
cml-cameron
cml-furongh
cml-hajiagha
cml-john
cml-ramani
cml-sfeizi
cml-tokekar

Faculty can manage this list of users via our Directory application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/) in the Security Groups section.  The security group that controls access has the prefix cml_ and then the faculty username.  It will also list slurm://nexusctl.umiacs.umd.edu as the associated URI.
You can check your account associations by running the show_assoc command to see the accounts you are associated with.  Please  contact staff and include your faculty member in the conversation if you do not see the appropriate association.

You can also see the total number of Track-able Resources (TRES) allowed for each account by running the following command. Please make sure you give the appropriate account that you are looking for. The billing number displayed here is the sum of  resource weightings for all nodes appropriated to that account.

$ sacctmgr show assoc account=cml format=user,account,qos,grptres
      User    Account                  QOS       GrpTRES

                  ...                                ...

︗QoS
CML currently has 5 QoS for the cml-dpart partition (though cml-high_long and cml-very_high may not be available to all faculty accounts), 1 QoS for the cml-scavenger partition, and 1 QoS for the cml-cpu partition.  If you do not specify a QoS when submitting your job using the --qos parameter, you will receive the cml-default QoS assuming you are using a CML account.
If your faculty member's Slurm account does not have one or both of the cml-high_long or cml-very_high QoS available to it, we can add it to their account provided they approve. Please  contact staff if this is desired.
The important part here is that in different QoS you can have a shorter/longer maximum wall time, a different total number of jobs running at once, and a different maximum number of track-able resources (TRES) for the job.  In the cml-scavenger QoS, one more constraint that you are restricted by is the total number of TRES per user (over multiple jobs).

︗Storage
There are 3 types of user storage available to users in the CML:

Home directories
Project directories
Scratch directories
There are also 2 types of read-only storage available for common use among users in the CML:

Dataset directories
Model directories
CML users can also request  Nexus project allocations.

︗Home Directories
You have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.
Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.
NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.

︗Project Directories
You can request project based allocations for up to 6TB for up to 120 days with one or more approvals:

Allocations up to and including 3TB require approval from a CML faculty member
Allocations above 3TB (up to 6TB) require approval from both a CML faculty member and the director of CML(The prior text links to https://ml.umd.edu/#team)
To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:

Project Name (short)
Description
Size (1TB, 2TB, etc.)
Length in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)
Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any
These allocations will be available from /fs/cml-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 120 days (requires re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML).  

If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.
If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.
This data is backed up nightly.

︗Scratch Directories
Scratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the CML compute infrastructure:

Network scratch directory
Local scratch directories
︗Network Scratch Directory
You have 200GB of scratch storage available at /cmlscratch/<username>.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.
You may request a permanent increase of up to 800GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 800GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory. Space increases beyond 800GB also have a maximum request period of 120 days (as with project directories), after which they will need to be renewed with re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML.

As with project directories, allocations over 3TB total space require approval from the director of CML(The prior text links to https://ml.umd.edu/#team) in addition to your faculty member.
This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.

︗Local Scratch Directories
Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.
These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.

︗Datasets
We have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/cml-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.
The list of CML datasets we currently host can be viewed here(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=CML).

︗Models
We have read-only model storage available at /fs/cml-models.  If there are models that you would like to see downloaded and made available, please see  this page.

︗Job Submission
SLURM offers a variety of ways to run jobs. It is important to understand the different options available and how to request the resources required for a job in order for it to run successfully. All job submission should be done from submit nodes; any computational code should be run in a job allocation on compute nodes. The following commands outline how to allocate resources on the compute nodes and submit processes to be run on the allocated nodes.
The cluster that everyone with a  UMIACS account has access to is Nexus. Please visit the Nexus page for instructions on how to connect to your assigned submit nodes.
Computationally intensive processes run on submission nodes will be terminated. Please submit jobs to be scheduled on compute nodes for this purpose.
For details on how SLURM decides how to schedule jobs when multiple jobs are waiting in a scheduler's queue, please see SLURM/Priority.

︗srun
The srun command is used to run a process on the compute nodes in the cluster. If you pass it a normal shell command (or command that executes a script), it will submit a job to run that shell command/script on a compute node and then return. srun accepts many command line options to specify the resources required by the command passed to it. Some common command line arguments are listed below and full documentation of all available options is available in the man page for srun, which can be accessed by running man srun.

$ srun --qos=default --mem=100mb --time=1:00:00 bash -c 'echo "Hello World from" `hostname`'
Hello World from tron33.umiacs.umd.edu

It is important to understand that srun is an interactive command. By default input to srun is broadcast to all compute nodes running your process and output from the compute nodes is redirected to srun. This behavior can be changed; however, srun will always wait for the command passed to finish before exiting, so if you start a long running process and end your terminal session, your process will stop running on the compute nodes and your job will end. To run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with  sbatch.

︗Common srun Arguments
--job-name=<JOBNAME> Requests your job be named <JOBNAME>
--mem=1g Requests 1GB of memory for your job, if no unit is given MB is assumed
--ntasks=2 Requests 2 "tasks" which map to cores on a CPU for your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each core
--nodes=2 Requests 2 nodes be allocated to your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each node
--nodelist=<NODENAME> Requests to run your job on the <NODENAME> node
--time=dd-hh:mm:ss Requests your job run for dd days, hh hours, mm minutes, and ss seconds
--error=<ERRNAME> Redirects stderr for your job to the <ERRNAME> file
--partition=<PARTITIONNAME> Requests your job run in the <PARTITIONNAME> partition
--qos=<QOSNAME>default Requests your job run with the <QOSNAME> QOS, to see the available QOS options on a cluster, run show_qos
--account=<ACCOUNTNAME> Requests your job runs under the <ACCOUNTNAME> Slurm account, different accounts have different available partitions/QOS
--output=<OUTNAME> Redirects stdout for your job to the <OUTNAME> file
--requeue Requests your job be automatically requeued if it is preempted
--exclusive Requests your job be the only one running on the node(s) it is assigned to. This requires that your job be allocated all of the resources on the node(s). The scheduler does not automatically give your job all of the node's/nodes' resources, however, so if you need more than the default, you still need to request these with --ntasks and --mem
︗Interactive Shell Sessions
An interactive shell session on a compute node can be useful for debugging or developing code that isn't ready to be run as a batch job. To get an interactive shell on a node, use srun with the --pty argument to invoke a shell:

$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash
$ hostname
tron33.umiacs.umd.edu

Please do not leave interactive shells running for long periods of time when you are not working. This blocks resources from being used by everyone else.

︗salloc
The salloc command can also be used to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script. Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation. When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.

$ salloc --qos=default -N 1 --mem=2g --time=01:00:00
salloc: Granted job allocation 159
$ srun /usr/bin/hostname
tron33.umiacs.umd.edu
$ exit
exit
salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 159

Please note that any commands not invoked with srun will be run locally on the submit node. Please be careful when using salloc.

︗sbatch
The sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes. To run a simple Hello World command on the compute nodes you could write a file, helloWorld.sh with the following contents:

#!/bin/bash

srun bash -c 'echo Hello World from `hostname`'

Then you need to submit the script with sbatch and request resources:

$ sbatch --qos=default --mem=1g --time=1:00:00 helloWorld.sh
Submitted batch job 121

SLURM will return a job number that you can use to check the status of your job with squeue:

$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
               121      tron helloWor username  R       0:01      1 tron32

︗Advanced Batch Scripts
You can also write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself. This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one "job step". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node. Since srun is blocks until the command finishes, we use the '&' operator to background the process so that both job steps can run at once; however, this means that we then need to use the wait command to block processing until all background processes have finished.

#!/bin/bash

# Lines that begin with #SBATCH specify commands to be used by SLURM for scheduling

#SBATCH --job-name=helloWorld                                        # sets the job name
#SBATCH --output=helloWorld.out.%j                                   # indicates a file to redirect STDOUT to; %j is the jobid. If set, must be set to a file instead of a directory or else submission will fail.
#SBATCH --error=helloWorld.out.%j                                    # indicates a file to redirect STDERR to; %j is the jobid. If set, must be set to a file instead of a directory or else submission will fail.
#SBATCH --time=00:05:00                                              # how long you would like your job to run; format=dd-hh:mm:ss
#SBATCH --qos=default                                                # set QOS, this will determine what resources can be requested
#SBATCH --nodes=2                                                    # number of nodes to allocate for your job
#SBATCH --ntasks=4                                                   # request 4 cpu cores be reserved for your node total
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2                                          # request 2 cpu cores be reserved per node
#SBATCH --mem=1g                                                     # memory required by job; if unit is not specified MB will be assumed. for multi-node jobs, this argument allocates this much memory *per node*

srun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &    # use srun to invoke commands within your job; using an '&'
srun --nodes=1 --mem=512m bash -c "hostname; python3 --version" &    # will background the process allowing them to run concurrently
wait                                                                 # wait for any background processes to complete

# once the end of the batch script is reached your job allocation will be revoked

Another useful thing to know is that you can pass additional arguments into your sbatch scripts on the command line and reference them as ${1} for the first argument and so on.

︗More Examples
SLURM/ArrayJobs
︗scancel
The scancel command can be used to cancel job allocations or job steps that are no longer needed. It can be passed individual job IDs or an option to delete all of your jobs or jobs that meet certain criteria.

scancel 255 cancel job 255
scancel 255.3 cancel job step 3 of job 255
scancel --user username --partition=tron cancel all jobs for username in the tron partition
︗Identifying Resources and Features
The sinfo command can show you additional features of nodes in the cluster but you need to ask it to show some non-default options using a command like sinfo -o "%40N %8c %8m %35f %35G".

$ sinfo -o "%40N %8c %8m %35f %35G"

Note that all of the nodes shown by this may not necessarily be in a partition you are able to submit to.
You can identify further specific information about a node using  scontrol with various flags.
There are also two command aliases developed by UMIACS staff to show various node information in aggregate. They are show_nodes and show_available_nodes.

︗show_nodes
The show_nodes command alias shows each node's name, number of CPUs, memory, {OS, CPU architecture, CPU type, GPU architecture (if the node has GPUs)} (as AVAIL_FEATURES), GRES (GPUs), and State. It essentially wraps the sinfo command with some pre-determined output format options and shows each node on its own line, in alphabetical order.
To only view nodes in a specific partition, append -p <partition name> to the command alias.

︗show_available_nodes
The show_available_nodes command alias takes zero or more arguments that correspond to Slurm constructs, resources, or features that you are looking to request a job with and tells you what nodes could theoretically[0,1] run a job with these arguments immediately. It assumes your job is a single-node job.
These arguments are:

--partition: Only include nodes in the specified partition(s).
--account: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified account(s).
--qos: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified QoS(es).
--cpus: Only include nodes with at least this many CPUs free.
--mem: Only include nodes with at least this much memory free. The default unit is MB if unspecified, but any of {K,M,G,T} can be suffixed to the number provided (will then be interpreted as KB, MB, GB, or TB, respectively).
GRES-related arguments:
--gres, --and-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains all of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings.
--or-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains any of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gres if only one GRES type/quantity pairing is specified.
GPU-related arguments:
--gpus, --and-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains all of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings.
--or-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains any of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gpus if only one GPU type/quantity pairing is specified.
Feature-related arguments:
--feature, --and-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains all of the specified feature(s).
--or-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains any of the specified feature(s). Functionally identical to --and-feature if only one feature is specified.
These arguments are also viewable by running show_available_nodes -h.
If your passed argument set does not contain any resource-based arguments (CPUs/RAM/GRES or GPUs), a node is defined as available if it has at least 1 CPU and 1MB of RAM available.
If there are no nodes available that meet your passed argument set, you will receive the message There are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.

︗Footnotes
[0] - As of now, this command alias does not factor in resources occupied by jobs that could be preempted (based on the partition(s) passed to it, if present). This is soon to come.
[1] - This command alias also does not factor in jobs with higher priority values requesting more resources, in the same partition(s), blocking execution of a job submitted with the arguments checked by the command alias. This is due to the complexity of calculating a job's priority value before it is actually submitted.

cbcb27
  cpus=59,mem=218303M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:6
...

(bogus example) Attempt to show nodes available in the bogus partition:

$ show_available_nodes --partition=bogus
There are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.

︗Requesting GPUs
If you need to do processing on a GPU, you will need to request that your job have access to GPUs just as you need to request processors or CPU cores. In SLURM, GPUs are considered "generic resources" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:#. If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec'd GPU.
Note that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs.

︗MPI example
To run MPI(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) jobs, you will need to include the --mpi=pmix flag in your submission arguments.

#!/usr/bin/bash 
#SBATCH --job-name=mpi_test # Job name 
#SBATCH --nodes=4 # Number of nodes 
#SBATCH --ntasks=8 # Number of MPI ranks 
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2 # Number of MPI ranks per node 
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-socket=1 # Number of tasks per processor socket on the node 
#SBATCH --time=00:30:00 # Time limit hrs:min:sec 


srun --mpi=pmix /nfshomes/username/testing/mpi/a.out

︗Datasets

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
UMIACS hosts a number of datasets in read-only mode on some shared filesystems used by our SLURM computing clusters. The motivation behind this is to provide publicly accessible datasets in a well-defined location in order to de-duplicate their use elsewhere, thus reducing overall storage usage.

︗Dataset Directories

 Vulcan (/fs/vulcan-datasets)
List of datasets(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Vulcan) -- faculty approver Abhinav Shrivastava
︗Requesting a new dataset
You can request a new dataset by  contacting staff with a link to the dataset's official download location. Mirrors and torrents/other peer-to-peer re-hosting are not allowed unless sanctioned by the dataset owners. 

CML/GAMMA/Vulcan: If the uncompressed/final dataset size is over 100GB, staff will first contact the faculty approver for the cluster to ensure they approve of using the storage space. If the size is under 100GB, no faculty approval is required. Staff will then inspect the dataset and see if there are any terms and conditions that must be agreed to before downloading.
Nexus: Please let staff know which faculty member's research you are working on that requires use of the dataset you are requesting. Then, if the uncompressed/final dataset size is over 50GB, the Director of Computing Facilities(The prior text links to https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/people/computing-staff) must first approve of using the storage space. If the size is under 50GB, no approval is required. Staff will then inspect the dataset and see if there are any terms and conditions that must be agreed to before downloading.
If there are no terms and conditions, staff will download/extract the dataset, copy it to the appropriate location depending on what cluster you are requesting it for, and let you know when it is available for use on that cluster.
If there are terms and conditions in excess of well-defined Creative Commons licenses(The prior text links to https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/), staff will first need to have the dataset's terms and conditions approved by UMD's Office of Research Administration (ORA)(The prior text links to https://ora.umd.edu/). Since the dataset will be hosted by UMIACS, as an institution, in a location accessible by all users of a cluster, not all of whom will have individually agreed to the terms and conditions, having a single person, staff member or not, agree to a set of terms and conditions is not sufficient to host it. After approval by ORA, staff will perform the same steps as mentioned above (download/extract, copy to appropriate location, and let you know when ready).

︗Dataset use
All datasets are read-only to users. Any intermediate data generated from a dataset will need to be stored in a location other than the shared filesystem hosting the dataset and other datasets.
Exceptions may be granted if there is a set of intermediate data generated from a dataset that you believe will be useful to a subset of a cluster's users. If you suspect this is the case for some of your generated data, please  contact staff. We will follow the above procedure and upon whatever approvals may be necessary, copy the intermediate data into the shared filesystem.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SSH contains the following information: 






︗SecureShell

From UMIACS
(Redirected from SSH)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Secure Shell (or SSH(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) is a network protocol allowing two computers to exchange data securely over an insecure network.  By default, use of SSH brings the user to a terminal, but the protocol can be used for other types of data transfer such as SFTP and SCP.

︗Contents

1 Connecting to an SSH Server
2 X11 Forwarding
3 SSH Tunneling
4 SSH Keys (and Passwordless SSH)
5 Verify remote host SSH fingerprint

5.1 Windows / PuTTY Verification
5.2 Other Platforms


6 Long Running Processes
7 Further Information


︗Connecting to an SSH Server
Under Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus.

# ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
Note: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.

This will give you access to a terminal on any one of the Nexus servers.  Note that by default you will not have access to applications that require X11 to run.
All UMIACS-supported Windows hosts are installed with PuTTY(The prior text links to http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/). If you are using a self-supported machine, you can either download and install PuTTY yourself, or if you are running a currently supported version of Windows(The prior text links to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education), you can install the OpenSSH client natively in Windows by following Microsoft's instructions here(The prior text links to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). Only the client is needed and not the server.

︗X11 Forwarding
By default, SSH only gives the user shell access to a host.  Enabling X11 Forwarding allows users to run applications with Graphical User Interfaces.
Under Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus using X11 Forwarding. Please note that under macOS, xQuartz(The prior text links to http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) is required on the client machine to forward X sessions from the remote session.

# ssh -Y username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
Note: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.

Under Windows, you will need to forward X through VcXsrv(The prior text links to http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) or another X11 application.
If using PuTTY, you will need to enable X forwarding. The option is under Connection > SSH > X11, shown below.
The image features the configuration window of the PuTTY application, specifically for enabling X11 forwarding within an SSH session. The window displays several categories on the left side, indicating different settings segments like "Session," "Terminal," "Window," and "Connection." Under the "Connection" category, further options appear, including "Data," "Proxy," "Rlogin," and "SSH." 

The primary focus of the image is on the "SSH" category, which encompasses various subcategories such as "Kex," "Cipher," "Auth," "TTY," and notably "X11." Within the "X11" section, there's a checkbox labeled "Enable X11 forwarding," which is checked, indicating that this feature is activated. Below the checkbox, there’s a field labeled "X display location," which is currently empty, suggesting where the display should be directed during an X11 session. 

At the bottom of the window, there are two buttons: "Open" and "Cancel," which facilitate the user's action to either proceed with the configuration or exit without changes. The overall aesthetic of the window is a standard Windows application interface, characterized by a simple, user-friendly layout.
If using the Windows Terminal app(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install), you will need to set an environment variable and then relaunch the app.

setx.exe DISPLAY "127.0.0.1:0.0"
After this has been done, every time you want to use X forwarding, you need to make sure VcXsrv or your other application has been started. If using VcXsrv, there will be an icon in your system tray.
You will now be able to use Xwindow programs from your SSH client.

︗SSH Tunneling
You can tunnel one or more ports through an SSH connection such that your packets will look like they are coming from the host you are tunneling to.   This is helpful for services that you would be normally blocked by a firewall.
Please see the SecureShellTunneling page for more information.

︗None
SSH can utilize public key encryption to authenticate and authorize users. This can be considered more secure especially if you secure your private key with a pass-phrase. The keys themselves are not susceptible to brute force attacks like normal passwords over SSH are.
Please see the SSH/Keys page for more information.
Note: UMIACS still requires multi-factor authentication if you are connecting from the public internet for security reasons. If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.

︗Verify remote host SSH fingerprint
The SSH protocol relies on host keys to verify the identify of a given host.  Each host as a unique key for the various different protocols supported.  
When connecting to a remove host for the first time, or when the remote host's local host key configuration has changed, you may see the following prompt:

$ ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu
The authenticity of host 'nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.73)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

It is considered best practice to verify the key fingerprint with the actual key of the host.  UMIACS maintains a reference of SSH key fingerprints available at the following link: 
https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys)
It is important to note that each key type has a different fingerprint.  Depending on your local configuration, your client may prefer a specific type of key.  The following commands can be used to determine the fingerprint of a given key type on a remote host:

$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu > key
# nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0
$ ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f key
2048 MD5:25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (RSA)

If you have any questions, or notice a discrepancy, please  contact staff.

︗None
If you use PuTTY to connect to remote hosts, the prompt will be similar to the following:
The image displays a security alert window from the PuTTY application, which is commonly used for SSH connections. The window features a prominent warning icon, indicating a security concern. The message identifies that the server's host key is not stored in the registry, alerting the user that they may not be connecting to the intended server.

The message details the server's fingerprint, listed as "ssh-ed25519" along with its corresponding key hash as "16:d2:75:bc:d9:1d:a6:9b:2f:2b:7a:58:ca:e4:30:69." The alert prompts the user with several options: "Yes," "No," "Cancel," and "Help." 

Selecting "Yes" would add the server's key to PuTTY's cache for future connections, while "No" would allow the user to proceed without caching the key just for this session. "Cancel" would terminate the connection attempt. The interface has a simple design typical of Windows applications, making options easy to distinguish. The alert serves as a reminder for users to verify server authenticity before proceeding.
If the host key reported by PuTTY matches the Documented entry for that host(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/ssh-fingerprints/blob/master/fingerprints), it is safe to click 'yes'.  If they do not match, please report the issue to staff@umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu).

︗Other Platforms
WinSCP(The prior text links to https://winscp.net/eng/docs/faq_hostkey)
MobaXterm(The prior text links to https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
︗Long Running Processes
If you are dealing with a long running process that is inhibiting your ability to work regularly, you may want to run your processes inside a screen on the host that you're connecting to. This way, if the connection is dropped for any reason the screen session will automatically detach on the host and will continue running so that you can reattach it at a later time when you've connected again. Please see our documentation on  GNU Screen for more information.

Using the lpr command is available, although the lp command is the main supported command and has more functionality.  We encourage you to use the lp (SysV) commands.

︗Discrete Queues
Since now the CUPS and WindowsPrinting systems are now discrete.  There can be jobs in the queue from the other print system that if they misbehave can cause the other print system queue to stall.  Please contact staff for assistance if you run into a problem.

︗Banner Pages
The queues are all no banner queues by default.  If you would like to change this behavior for your account you can for each PRINTER_QUEUE by running 

  lpoptions -o job-sheets=standard PRINTER_QUEUE

︗Types of Rooms
 Moderated Rooms
These seminar and large conference areas must have reservations accepted by the designated moderator(s) for the room. They have room PCs, so bringing your own device is not required to use the display.
 Auto-Accept Rooms
These 6-12 person rooms will automatically accept reservations without requiring moderation. They have room PCs, so bringing your own device is not required to use the display.
 Huddle Rooms
These 1-3 person rooms can only be reserved at the touch panel. They cannot be scheduled ahead of time through Google Calendar. They do not have room PCs, so you must bring your own device to use the display.
︗Common Tasks
 Viewing one or more rooms
 Reserving a room
 [For moderators] Approving a room request
 [For moderators] Enabling notifications for pending requests
︗Viewing
Conference room availability can be  viewed with UMD’s Google Calendar system or from a touch panel outside each individual room.  The touch panel quickly allows you to see the status of the room: red if the room is reserved right now and green if it is open.
We also offer a list of conference rooms scheduled with the UMD Google Calendar system.

︗Scheduling
Conference rooms are  reserved with UMD’s Google Calendar system along with a touch panel outside the room.  The touch panel quickly allows you to see the status of the room: red if the room is reserved right now and green if it is open.  You can walk up to the panel and reserve the room if it is unoccupied within the next 12 hours (non-moderated rooms only).

︗Room Capabilities
Our conference rooms have different AV capabilities depending on what equipment each specific room is equipped with (which is generally based on the size of the room).  In all rooms, you should at a minimum be able to either plug in your laptop to display to the projector and screen(s), or use the  Solstice Mersive Pod found in each room to display wirelessly.
Topics:

 Using the Touch Panel
 Using the Solstice Mersive Pods
 Recording and Streaming
 Using Zoom

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/PATH contains the following information: 






︗EnvironmentalVariables

From UMIACS
(Redirected from PATH)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
In UNIX and Windows many of the commands run have variables that are parsed from a user's environment.

︗None
The most common variable is the PATH variable, which will add additional paths to search for programs to be run from the command line. These can be set in many ways but we will cover the most popular: tcsh and bash. You can see your PATH variable by using the built-in echo command in the shell.  When printing out environment variables you will need to prefix the variable with the $ sign.

$ echo $PATH
/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

In almost all cases you will want to append to either the beginning or end of your PATH variable and not replace it fully as this will most likely decrease the functionality of your shell.  For example, if you wanted to add the path /opt/UMtorque/bin to the end of your PATH then you could do the following,

tcsh/csh
setenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin
bash/sh
export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/bin
These can be either typed into your shell directly or added to your shell's initialization files so every time you spawn a shell it will get this new PATH.

︗None
To modify the Windows PATH Environmental Variable do the following: 

Go to Control Panel and click on User Accounts. Then click on the User Accounts heading within User Accounts.
On the left pane, click Change my environment variables.
Under User Variables for <username> choose the PATH variable.
If there is none, click New and put PATH for the Variable name.
Click Edit and append the location you are trying to add. Different paths are separated by semicolons.
To verify that the PATH variable has been modified properly do the following:

Open a new Command Prompt (Start -> Accessories -> Command Prompt).
Type in PATH.
The updated PATH should be printed.

5.4 Datasets




︗Access
You can always find out what hosts you have access to submit via the Nexus#Access page.  The GAMMA lab in particular has a special submission host that has additional local storage available.

nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu
Please do not run anything on the login node. Always allocate yourself machines on the compute nodes (see instructions below) to run any job.

︗Quality of Service
GAMMA users have access to all of the  standard job QoSes in the gamma partition using the gamma account.
The additional job QoSes for the GAMMA partition specifically are:

huge-long: Allows for longer jobs using higher overall resources.
Please note that the partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on the partition-specific nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use.

From nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu you can run the following example to submit an interactive job.  Please note that you need to specify the --partition and --account.  Please refer to our SLURM documentation about about how to further customize your submissions including making a batch submission.  The following command will allocate 8 GPUs for 2 days in an interactive session.  Change parameters accordingly to your needs.  We discourage use of srun and promote use of sbatch for fair use of GPUs.

$ srun --pty --gres=gpu:8 --account=gamma --partition=gamma --qos=huge-long bash

python your_file.py

︗Storage
There are 3 types of user storage available to users in GAMMA:

Home directories
Project directories
Scratch directories
There is also read-only storage available for Dataset directories.
GAMMA users can also request  Nexus project allocations.

︗Home Directories
You have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.
Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.
NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.

︗Project Directories
You can request project based allocations for up to 8TB and up to 180 days with approval from a GAMMA faculty member.  
To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that approved the project in the conversation.  Please include the following details:

Project Name (short)
Description
Size (1TB, 2TB, etc.)
Length in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)
Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any
These allocations will be available from /fs/gamma-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation (requires re-approval from a GAMMA faculty member).

If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.
If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.
This data is backed up nightly.

︗Scratch Directories
Scratch data has no data protection, there are no snapshots and the data is not backed up. 
There are two types of scratch directories:

Network scratch directory
Local scratch directories
︗Network Scratch Directory
You are allocated 100GB of scratch space via NFS from /gammascratch/$username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.
This directory is automounted so you may not see your directory if you run ls /gammascratch but it will be mounted when you cd into your /gammascratch directory.
You may request a permanent increase of up to 200GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 200GB, you will need faculty approval. 
This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.

︗Local Scratch Directories
These file systems are not available over NFS and there are no backups or snapshots available for these file systems.

Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These directories are local to each node, ie. the /scratch0 on two different nodes are completely separate.
These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.
These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.
Gamma has invested in a 20TB NVMe scratch file system on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu that is available as /scratch1.  To utilize this space, you will need to copy data from/to this over SSH from a compute node.  To make this easier, you may want to setup SSH keys that will allow you to copy data without prompting for passwords.
The /scratch1 directory on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu doesn't have a tmpwatch. The files in this directory need to be manually removed once they are no longer needed.
︗Datasets
We have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/gamma-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.
The list of GAMMA datasets we currently host can be viewed here(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=GAMMA).

︗Windows Patch Management

From UMIACS
(Redirected from LANDesk)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
In order to combat the ever increasing number of 3rd party security vulnerabilities on Windows machines, UMIACS staff has deployed Ivanti Security and Compliance Manager. As security threats have evolved from the operating system to applications we have had to take this step in order to maintain operational security for the Institute. Currently the updates are focused on applications that are exposed to the internet such as web browsers, teleconferencing solutions, Adobe Flash, Java, etc.
Ivanti is currently deployed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as  Enterprise supported Windows laptops and home machines.

︗Automated Scanning
Patches are deployed during the week leading up to the maintenance window. Specifically, they will always be released on the Wednesday that falls between the 9th and the 15th of every month, and typically in the morning.

Desktops will scan for updates to be installed every night sometime between 7pm and 9pm. If you are not logged in during those times, the system will automatically install the patches and reboot if necessary. If you remain active on your system during those times, you will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.
Laptops will scan for updates to be installed at least once every day (assuming the laptop is powered on). This will only occur when the laptop has an active Internet connection (wired or wireless). You will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.
Installation can be deferred until lock/logoff if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, installation will automatically proceed:

Desktops: 24 hours
Laptops: 3 hours
If a reboot is required after installation finishes, you will receive another pop up. It is highly suggested to reboot right away due to system instability and vulnerability. However, reboot can be deferred for up to 6 days if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, the machine will automatically reboot:

Desktops: 24 hours
Laptops: 9 hours
If you interrupt the installation process between when the first patch begins installing and when the last patch finishes installing, Ivanti may ask to reboot before continuing to install the remaining patches next time it pops up. This is by design. If you would like to avoid multiple reboots on a machine that is used intermittently (such as a laptop), we would recommend starting a manual scan just before you stop using the machine for the night and then letting the machine download and apply all patches overnight. See below section for how to do this.

︗Manual Scanning
This should only need to be done on laptops or home machines in the event that Ivanti has not had a large enough time window to scan your computer recently, but can be optionally done if you see fit. Please note you will need an active Internet connection for this to work, however you do not need to be on the UMIACS VPN.

Search for "Security Scan" from the Start menu and click the result that shows up (should show a shield icon). The scan will begin. Patches will be detected and downloaded.
Note: The scan may fail on the "Checking for other running scanners" step if Ivanti is already running an invisible scan in the background. If this occurs, wait 10-15 minutes and then retry the scan.
The image depicts a Windows desktop interface, showcasing the search function. On the left side, there is a vertical taskbar featuring icons for various applications and settings, including a gear icon representing settings, which is often found at the bottom. The main focus is on the search box at the top, with the text "Security Scan" displayed as the best match for a desktop application. 

Below this, a list of search suggestions populates the interface, indicating related terms such as "security scanner," "security scanning," and variations for free or additional tools.

︗Background
Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)(The prior text links to https://obsproject.com/) is free and open source software for video recording and live streaming. It is simple to set up and highly customizable. At UMIACS, it is the software we recommend to users looking to either record or stream on either their personal computers or in a conference room or auditorium setting.

︗Conference Quick Setup
Below are steps outlining how to start recording or streaming your meetings. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk. 

Select the source you'd like to route to the computer via the "Shared Media" option on the Crestron control panel. This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.
Download (windows zip file)(The prior text links to https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases) and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.
Set up video.
Click the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.
Ensure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called 'AV Bridge'.
Click OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.
If the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack's default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.
Ensure audio settings look OK.
The default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.
Keep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.
Set up either streaming, recording, or both as follows.
Streaming:

Go to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).
Locate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this.
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard(The prior text links to https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard), near the bottom
Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings(The prior text links to https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings), at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.
Enter your key and hit OK.
Click Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom.
Recording:

Go to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive. We have observed that using external HDDs may introduce dropped frames due to encoding lag because of I/O bottlenecks.
Click Start Recording under the Control pane at the bottom.

︗Contents

1 Overview
2 BitLocker at UMIACS

2.1 Recovery Key Prompts
2.2 Temporarily Suspending Bitlocker




︗Overview
BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature available in all modern versions of Windows. Having BitLocker integrated with the operating system addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.
Data on a lost or stolen computer is vulnerable to unauthorized access, either by running a software-attack tool against it or by transferring the computer's hard disk to a different computer. BitLocker helps mitigate unauthorized data access by enhancing file and system protections. BitLocker also helps render data inaccessible when BitLocker-protected computers are decommissioned or recycled.
Official Microsoft documentation can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview(The prior text links to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview)

︗BitLocker at UMIACS
All of our supported personal office workstations as well all  enterprise or base-supported laptops and home machines will have BitLocker enabled by UMIACS staff as part of each machine's install process.

︗Recovery Key Prompts
Ordinarily, no interaction should be required with BitLocker to keep it in a functional state. However, a few circumstances may lead to BitLocker detecting changes to the system boot information and prevent the computer from reaching Windows. This is by design.
The image displays a text-based user interface for entering a recovery key for Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption. The background is a solid black, creating a stark contrast with the white text displayed on the screen. At the top, "Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption Recovery Key Entry" is prominently displayed, indicating that users need to authenticate access to a BitLocker-protected drive. Below that, there's a prompt reading "Enter the recovery key for this drive," followed by a series of blank boxes labeled as "Drive Label" and "Recovery Key ID" where the user is expected to input information.

The instructions specify using the function keys (F1 - F9) to input digits 1 through 9 and the F10 key for 0. Additionally, it mentions utilizing the TAB, SHIFT-TAB, HOME, and ARROW keys for navigation within the input fields, while the UP and DOWN ARROW keys can modify previously entered digits. At the bottom, the options "ENTER=Continue" and "ESC=Exit" suggest actions for the user following their input. This interface highlights the importance of entering the correct recovery key to regain access to the encrypted drive.
Some factors that may cause this (not exhaustive):

BIOS or firmware updates -- some manufacturer automatic driver update utilities include these by default - beware!
DVDs or USB drives inserted or plugged in during boot
Malware on the system
The first step should always be to disconnect any external devices and then power the machine off and back on. This ensures that the hardware configuration of the machine is the same as it was when UMIACS staff initially enabled BitLocker. If the prompt still pops up, please contact UMIACS staff for further troubleshooting.

︗Temporarily Suspending Bitlocker
In the event that you encounter the recovery screen above, after booting back into Windows, follow these steps to ensure the prompt does not appear on subsequent reboots. The first two steps can also be taken proactively if you know you will be making a change that affects BitLocker. (see above)

︗Perl/Environment

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
We recommend using local::lib to create your own directory of Perl packages downloaded from CPAN.  This will create an isolated collection of packages, that will not affect the system version of Perl.  This allows users to quickly bootstrap a local Perl Module library.


︗Contents

1 Creating an Environment
2 Module Management

2.1 Installing Modules
2.2 Listing Installed Modules


3 Creating additional Environments


︗Creating an Environment
You will first need to download a copy of local::lib. This can be found by searching local::lib at http://search.cpan.org/(The prior text links to http://search.cpan.org/)
Decompress and extract the package:
-bash-3.2$ gunzip local-lib-2.000019.tar.gz
-bash-3.2$ tar xvf local-lib-2.000019.tar

Configure and then install the environment:
-bash-3.2$ cd local-lib-2.000019
-bash-3.2$ perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap
-bash-3.2$ make test && make install

Add the newly created environment to your initialization scripts.  After this step is complete, you will need to start a new shell.
echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >>~/.bashrc
Note: Depending on your current initialization script setup, you may need to add the line generated by the above command to your .bash_profile as well. (Or the tcsh equivalent)

︗Module Management
︗Installing Modules
Once your environment has been created and properly sourced, you can then install packages with cpan as your normally would:

-bash-3.2$ cpan -i Date::Tolkien::Shire;

For more information on module installation, see  http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html(The prior text links to http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html)

︗Listing Installed Modules
The following command will list all the Perl Modules installed in the currently sourced environment:

-bash-3.2$ perldoc perllocal

︗Creating additional Environments
By default your environment will be created in the ~/perl5 directory.  It is possible to create multiple environments by specifying a directory in when building the environment:

-bash-3.2$ cd local-lib-2.000019
-bash-3.2$ perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap=/Path/to/Second/Environment
-bash-3.2$ make test && make install

It is important to keep in mind that you will need to adjust the line in your initialization scrips to reflect the location of the Environment you wish to use.

1 Port Forwarding

1.1 OpenSSH
1.2 PuTTY


2 SOCKS Proxy

2.1 OpenSSH
2.2 PuTTY
2.3 Example: SOCKS proxy, Browser configuration




︗Port Forwarding
︗OpenSSH
When you want to just forward a specific port locally to a remote port with Linux or macOS systems.   


This example will create a local port 9999 that will be forwarded to the remote host webserver.umiacs.umd.edu and its port 8000 through the host nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu.
        ssh -NfL 9999:webserver.umiacs.umd.edu:8000 nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu

This example will create a local port 13389 that will be forwarded to a remote host that is running a RDP client like Windows through the host nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu
        ssh -L 13389:my-desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu:3389 nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu

The following example outlines how to use SSH tunnel for printing to the UMIACS CUPS server.
        ssh $<USERNAME>@nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu -T -N -L 3631:print.umiacs.umd.edu:631

Once the tunnel is established you can follow the normal  Printing instructions substitution 'print.umiacs.umd.edu' for 'localhost:3631', or print via the a command such as the following:
        lpr -H 127.0.0.1:3631 -P $<PRINTER NAME> $<FILENAME>


︗PuTTY
Windows users can achieve the same types of tunnels using PuTTY or a similar SSH client. In PuTTY, the port forwarding configuration dialogue can be found under "Connection>SSH>Tunnels".
The image depicts the PuTTY configuration interface on a Windows operating system, specifically focusing on the settings for SSH port forwarding. 

In the left pane, multiple categories are listed under "Category" such as "Keyboard," "Bell," "Features," and several others related to connection settings. The "Connection" category is expanded, highlighting options for "Data," "Proxy," "Telnet," "Rlogin," and "SSH" settings.

The main area displays "Options controlling SSH port forwarding." Here, specific options allow the user to configure forwarding settings. There is a checkbox for "Local ports accept connections from other hosts" and another for "Remote ports do the same (SSH-2 only)." Below, the section labeled "Forwarded ports" lists a port forwarding entry marked "L8888," indicating a local forwarding setup to the remote destination "clipsm301.umiacs.umd.edu:8000."

Further down, a section titled "Add new forwarded port" contains fields for the "Source port" set to "8889" and the "Destination," which is configured to "clipsm301.umiacs.umd.edu:8000." At the bottom, there are options for selecting the address type (Auto, IPv4, or IPv6) and buttons labeled "Open," "Cancel," and "Add."

The interface is rich in visual detail, with a color scheme typical of Windows applications, primarily blue and white, and the layout is organized for ease of user navigation.
This example will create a local port 8889 that is attached to the remote host clipsm301.umiacs.umd.edu on its port 8000.

︗SOCKS Proxy
︗OpenSSH
SSH can also tunnel all traffic coming into a certain port through a SOCKS v5 proxy.  Many browsers and some operating systems can be setup to then connect to this proxy to allow them again to look like they are coming from the host name you specify in your SSH command. 

ssh -ND 7777 nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu
Please note: when you configure proxy settings for a browser (or your whole operating system) all the traffic for that browser (or the OS) will be sent through the proxy.  This can have performance implications.

︗PuTTY
Windows users can tunnel traffic coming into a certain port through a SOCKS v5 proxy by using PuTTY or a similar SSH client. Many browsers and some operating systems can be setup to connect to this proxy to allow them to look like they are coming from the host name you specify.
In PuTTY under Sessions set the Host Name:
The image depicts the PuTTY configuration window on a Windows operating system, showcasing the options available for setting up a new SSH session. The primary focus is on the "Session" category, clearly outlined on the left pane, which includes additional subcategories such as "Logging," "Terminal," "Keyboard," and others.

At the top, the main area directs users to specify the "Host Name (or IP address)" and the port number—set to "22" by default. Below this, the "Connection type" is indicated as SSH, with options for Raw, Telnet, and Rlogin also visible. 

A section for "Saved Sessions" allows users to manage previously stored sessions, with "Default Settings" highlighted and options to Load, Save, or Delete stored configurations. The window features common Windows UI elements, including buttons labeled "Open," "Cancel," and "Help" at the bottom. 

The overall design includes a primarily white and light gray color scheme, with blue accents, typical of many Windows applications, emphasizing clarity and ease of navigation. The layout effectively supports user interaction for configuring SSH connections.
Then under Connection > SSH > Tunnels enter a port number and set the type of forwarding to "Dynamic" and press add:
The image depicts the PuTTY configuration interface on a Windows operating system, specifically for SSH port forwarding. The left pane lists several categories, including "Terminal," "Window," and "Connection," with the "Connection" section expanded to reveal subcategories like "Data," "Proxy," and "SSH." The main area of the interface focuses on the "Options controlling SSH port forwarding."

Here, the "Port forwarding" section contains two checkboxes: one labeled "Local ports accept connections from other hosts" and another for "Remote ports do the same (SSH-2 only)." The "Forwarded ports" section indicates an entry for port "D7777," with the option to remove it.

At the bottom, users can add a new forwarded port, with fields labeled "Source port" set to "7777" and "Destination" available for specification. Users can choose the type of destination connection—Local, Remote, or Dynamic—along with selecting the address type (Auto, IPv4, or IPv6). The interface design exhibits a typical Windows color scheme, primarily white and blue, with clearly labeled buttons for "Open," "Cancel," and "Help," facilitating easy navigation for configuration.
Click Open and log into the host.
As long as this PuTTY window is open and you are logged in, you can use the SOCKS proxy.
Please note that when you configure proxy settings for a browser or your whole operating system, all the traffic for that browser or your OS will be sent through the proxy.  This can have performance implications.

︗None
There are too many variations here to cover them all, but they all follow the same general pattern and the following example should be generally applicable. We'll use Firefox for this example. Screenshots are from Firefox 37.0.2.

Under Preferences > Advanced > Network > Connection > Settings..., choose Manually proxy configuration:.
Enter 127.0.0.1 for the proxy.
Enter the port you chose earlier for dynamic forwarding (7777 in the example above).
Check Use this proxy server for all protocols, and then click OK.
NOTE: this will continue to send all browser traffic through your SSH tunnel until the configuration is reverted. The SSH connection must be established for traffic to pass through to the destination network. Firefox has a very useful plugin called "FoxyProxy" that allows conditional proxies to be set up, if you're interested in adding some intelligence/complexity to your proxy configuration.
The image displays the "Advanced" settings of the Firefox browser on a Mac operating system, focusing on the "Network" tab. The layout consists of a white background with a gray header labeled "Advanced," featuring several icons for different settings categories, such as "General," "Data Choices," "Network," "Update," "Certificates," and more. 

In the central area, the "Connection" section offers options to configure how Firefox connects to the Internet, with a button labeled "Settings..." inviting user interaction. Below this, a status message indicates the current web content cache usage, noting a size of 224 MB out of a specified disk space limit, which the user can customize. Options for managing the cache include a "Clear Now" button and a checkbox for overriding automatic cache management with an input field to set the limit.

Further down, there's a segment titled "Offline Web Content and User Data," which indicates that the application cache is currently using 0 bytes, with a button to clear this cache. An informational message suggests a user action if certain web applications prompt for offline storage. Overall, the interface is organized for clarity, with a professional aesthetic typical of macOS applications. The image displays the "Advanced" settings menu of the Firefox browser on a Mac operating system, specifically focusing on network configuration options. The interface includes a light gray header labeled "Advanced" with various icons representing different setting categories like "General," "Data Choices," and "Network." The main section titled "Configure Proxies to Access the Internet" is clearly visible, showcasing several options for setting up network connections.

In this section, radio buttons allow users to select between “No proxy,” “Auto-detect proxy settings for this network,” “Use system proxy settings,” or the highlighted “Manual proxy configuration.” The "Manual proxy configuration" section lists fields for HTTP Proxy, SSL Proxy, FTP Proxy, and SOCKS Host, all set to the local IP address “127.0.0.1,” indicating the use of a local proxy. Each entry includes a corresponding Port field, all set to “7777.” 

Additional options include checkboxes for using the proxy for all protocols and specifying no proxy for certain addresses. Below, there are buttons labeled "Reload" and "OK," facilitating user actions. The overall layout is clean and intuitive, typical of macOS design, ensuring usability and accessibility.

︗VS Code

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Visual Studio (VS) Code(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a multi-platform source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be used with a variety of programming languages and can have its base functionality extended through extensions available via its marketplace(The prior text links to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). The base editor itself is free, but some extensions may require paid subscriptions.

︗Contents

1 Cluster Usage

1.1 Best Practices

1.1.1 Use only as a code editor
1.1.2 Do not open large files
1.1.3 Clean up when done




2 Common Issues


︗Cluster Usage
It can be convenient when using our SLURM computing clusters to open a connection to a VS Code Server(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server) session on the submission node(s) that you have access to via VS Code's Remote - SSH extension(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh). Steps to set this up can be found here(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_installation). Use your UMIACS username and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN)(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) of the submission node you want to connect to. Password authentication does not provide an option to save your password, so for convenience, you may want to set up an  SSH key.
For a list of active issues with the Remote - SSH extension, please see Microsoft's GitHub tracker here(The prior text links to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/labels/ssh).

︗Best Practices
Because of the multi-tenant nature of our submission nodes, using the Remote - SSH extension to connect to a VS Code Server running on a submission node can have adverse affects on other users simultaneously using the submission nodes if not properly managed. The following is a list of "best practices" that we ask you please follow to minimize the chance of impacting others on submission nodes. We have compiled the list through observation as well as through discussion with users.

︗Use only as a code editor
VS Code can perform many common file management operations, such as moving, copying, or deleting files or directories. However, the overhead of providing progress updates / status messages through VS Code's UI can cause load spikes that result in other processes on the submission node (both system-level and other users') slowing down. This is especially the case if operating on thousands to millions of small image or video files. In extreme cases, it can seem as though the submission node is wholly unresponsive.
The best way to combat this is to use VS Code as just a code editor as strictly as you can (meaning creating new and/or editing existing source code files only). Use standard command-line programs such as mv/cp/rm in VS Code's terminal window or a separate application's terminal window for local file management instead, or use the techniques advertised  here for larger data transfers between nodes.

︗Do not open large files
Files that you open in VS Code's text editor on a remote machine through the Remote - SSH extension are loaded entirely into RAM on the remote machine. Because of the persistence of VS Code Server processes, opening several unique files may result in them all remaining in RAM for extended periods of time even if you no longer have tabs open for them in the Tab Bar.
As such, please refrain from opening large files (more than a few MB) in VS Code itself on submission nodes. Either use a lighter-weight command-line based text editor such as vim(The prior text links to https://www.vim.org/) or otherwise on the submission node itself, or first  transfer the files that you would like to open to either a less-used remote machine or your local machine before opening them.
If you absolutely need to open one or more large files for a very brief period of time on a submission node, please clean up your server session on that node (see below section) as soon as possible when done.

︗Clean up when done
If you are done using VS Code for an extended period of time (several hours / overnight), consider manually killing your server session on the submission node when exiting. By default, VS Code Server will keep the processes used by your session active for a few hours after you disconnect, keeping the VS Code Server processes on the submission node you were using alive, despite no longer actively being used.
This can be done by opening the Command Palette(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching "Kill VS Code Server on Host...".

The image depicts a visual representation of the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) interface focused on the command palette feature. The top portion shows a search bar with the text “>Kill VS Code Server on Host…”, indicating an action option within the command palette. Below this, the categorized selection highlights the choice "Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host..." marked as “recently used.” 

The background features a dark theme typical of coding environments, with shades of gray and blue dominating the color scheme, enhancing visual clarity against the lighter text. The design elements maintain a clean interface, emphasizing functionality with clear categories and readable font size. The overall spatial arrangement conveys a user-friendly experience, allowing quick access to command executions essential for managing the VS Code Server on a host while using the Remote - SSH extension. This image effectively communicates an active coding utility critical for developers working in remote environments.
Select the submission node you were using and click on it.

The image displays a user interface from Visual Studio Code (VS Code), specifically focusing on the command palette feature utilized for connecting to submission nodes. At the top, there's a search input bar partially filled with the text "nexus," indicating an active search query. Below this bar, two connection options are presented in a dark-themed list format. Each option is labeled "nexus" followed by the domains "00.umiacs.umd.edu" and "01.umiacs.umd.edu," visually differentiated with a slightly lighter blue highlight against the dark background. This arrangement facilitates easy recognition and selection for connecting to specific nodes. The overall color scheme features dark gray with blue accents, typical of coding environments, contributing to a clean and user-friendly interface. The design emphasizes readability and navigational efficiency, essential for developers practicing remote integration through the VS Code Remote - SSH extension. This image effectively illustrates a common interaction point for users managing their connections to remote computing resources.
Wait a few seconds and you should get a message confirming the command went through.

The image displays a notification from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) confirming the action of terminating a server session. The message reads "Killed VS Code Server on nexus" followed by the specific node identifier "00.umiacs.umd.edu." The notification is presented in a dark-themed interface, consistent with VS Code's aesthetic, which enhances visibility of the text against the background. On the right side, a button labeled “Open Logs” is visible, indicating the option for users to access log information related to this action. The source of this notification is specified as "Remote - SSH," underlining the context in which the server session was terminated. The overall layout is minimalist, focusing on clarity and immediate feedback for the user. The dark gray and blue color scheme aligns with common design principles in coding environments, promoting a clean and efficient user experience. This image illustrates an essential utility feature, emphasizing user control over remote server management within VS Code.
The next time you connect to the same submission node, you will have a fresh VS Code session on it.

︗Common Issues
If you are having trouble SSH'ing to a submission node with VS Code, check if your home directory is full.

Connect to one of your Nexus submission nodes via SSH not using VS Code.
 Remote connect to a server
Navigate to your home directory. cd ~
Check if it is full. df -h .
If it is full (Avail 0), delete some files to free up at least ~100MB of space. Filesystem                                    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes   30G   30G     0 100% /fs/nfshomes
Try connecting with VS Code again.

Go to Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and Sharing Center.
Click "Change adapter settings" on the left.
Right click on the network adapter you're using, choose "Properties" from the context menu.
Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click on the "Properties" button.
If not selected, choose "Use the following DNS server addresses:"
Enter the public DNS addresses you desire to use.
Click OK, and close the remaining windows.
macOS: System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi/Ethernet > Details > DNS
Linux: Edit your /etc/resolv.conf file and change the IP addresses after "nameserver" to any of those listed above.
︗Manual Lookup
If you are having problems getting to UMIACS hosts, you can use our name servers to resolve those specific host names and then connect using the IP addresses you lookup. Our name servers are 128.8.120.19, 128.8.120.50, and 128.8.132.75. To use this information to get the IP address of the host somehost.umiacs.umd.edu, you would use the command nslookup somehost.umiacs.umd.edu 128.8.120.19, from a Windows, macOS, or Linux command prompt / terminal.

5 Room Capabilities


︗Types of Rooms
 Moderated Rooms
These seminar and large conference areas must have reservations accepted by the designated moderator(s) for the room. They have room PCs, so bringing your own device is not required to use the display.
 Auto-Accept Rooms
These 6-12 person rooms will automatically accept reservations without requiring moderation. They have room PCs, so bringing your own device is not required to use the display.
 Huddle Rooms
These 1-3 person rooms can only be reserved at the touch panel. They cannot be scheduled ahead of time through Google Calendar. They do not have room PCs, so you must bring your own device to use the display.
︗Common Tasks
 Viewing one or more rooms
 Reserving a room
 [For moderators] Approving a room request
 [For moderators] Enabling notifications for pending requests
︗Viewing
Conference room availability can be  viewed with UMD’s Google Calendar system or from a touch panel outside each individual room.  The touch panel quickly allows you to see the status of the room: red if the room is reserved right now and green if it is open.
We also offer a list of conference rooms scheduled with the UMD Google Calendar system.

︗Scheduling
Conference rooms are  reserved with UMD’s Google Calendar system along with a touch panel outside the room.  The touch panel quickly allows you to see the status of the room: red if the room is reserved right now and green if it is open.  You can walk up to the panel and reserve the room if it is unoccupied within the next 12 hours (non-moderated rooms only).

︗Room Capabilities
Our conference rooms have different AV capabilities depending on what equipment each specific room is equipped with (which is generally based on the size of the room).  In all rooms, you should at a minimum be able to either plug in your laptop to display to the projector and screen(s), or use the  Solstice Mersive Pod found in each room to display wirelessly.
Topics:

 Using the Touch Panel
 Using the Solstice Mersive Pods
 Recording and Streaming

︗SLURM/JobStatus

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
︗Contents

1 Job Status

1.1 squeue
1.2 sstat
1.3 sacct


2 Job Codes


︗Job Status
SLURM offers a variety of tools to check the status of your jobs before, during, and after execution. When you first submit your job, SLURM should give you a job ID which represents the resources allocated to your job. Individual calls to srun will spawn job steps which can also be queried individually.

︗squeue
The squeue command shows job status in the queue. Helpful flags:

-u username to show only your jobs (replace username with your UMIACS username)
--start to estimate start time for a job that has not yet started and the reason why it is waiting
-s to show the status of individual job steps for a job (e.g. batch jobs)
Examples:

[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ squeue -u username
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
               162      tron helloWor username  R       0:03      2 tron[00-01]

[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ squeue --start -u username
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST          START_TIME  NODES SCHEDNODES           NODELIST(REASON)
               163      tron helloWo2 username PD 2020-05-11T18:36:49      1 tron02               (Priority)

[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ squeue -s -u username
         STEPID     NAME PARTITION     USER      TIME NODELIST
          162.0    sleep      tron username      0:05 tron00
          162.1    sleep      tron username      0:05 tron01

︗sstat
The sstat command shows metrics from currently running job steps. If you don't specify a job step, the lowest job step is displayed.

sstat --format JobID,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize <$JOBID>.<$JOBSTEP>

[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ sstat --format JobID,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize 171
       JobID   NTasks             Nodelist     MaxRSS  MaxVMSize     AveRSS  AveVMSize 
------------ -------- -------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- 
171.0               1               tron00          0    186060K          0    107900K 
[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ sstat --format JobID,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize 171.1
       JobID   NTasks             Nodelist     MaxRSS  MaxVMSize     AveRSS  AveVMSize 
------------ -------- -------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------

Note that if you do not have any jobsteps, sstat will return an error.

[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ sstat --format JobID,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize 172
       JobID   NTasks             Nodelist     MaxRSS  MaxVMSize     AveRSS  AveVMSize 
------------ -------- -------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
sstat: error: no steps running for job 237

If you do not run any srun commands, you will not create any job steps and metrics will not be available for your job. Your batch scripts should follow this format:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH ...
#SBATCH ...
# set environment up
module load ...

# launch job steps
srun <command to run> # that would be step 1
srun <command to run> # that would be step 2

︗sacct
The sacct command shows metrics from past jobs.

[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ sacct
       JobID    JobName  Partition    Account  AllocCPUS      State ExitCode 
------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------- 
162          helloWorld       tron      nexus          2  COMPLETED      0:0 
162.batch         batch                 nexus          1  COMPLETED      0:0 
162.0             sleep                 nexus          1  COMPLETED      0:0 
162.1             sleep                 nexus          1  COMPLETED      0:0 
163          helloWorld       tron      nexus          2  COMPLETED      0:0

163.0             sleep                 nexus          1  COMPLETED      0:0 

To check one specific job, you can run something like the following (if you omit .<$JOBSTEP>, all jobsteps will be shown):

sacct  --format JobID,jobname,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize,Elapsed -j <$JOBID>.<$JOBSTEP>
[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ sacct --format JobID,jobname,NTasks,nodelist,MaxRSS,MaxVMSize,AveRSS,AveVMSize,Elapsed -j 171

︗Job Codes
If you list the current running jobs and your job is in PD (Pending), SLURM will provide you some information on what the reason for this in the NODELIST parameter.  You can use scontrol show job <jobid> to get all the parameters for your job to help identify why your job is not running.

[username@nexusclip00 ~]$ squeue -u username
JOBID  PARTITION     NAME     USER     ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
1           tron     bash     username PD       0:00      1 (AssocGrpGRES)
2           tron     bash     username PD       0:00      1 (Resources)
3           tron     bash     username PD       0:00      1 (Priority)
4           tron     bash     username PD       0:00      1 (QOSMaxGRESPerUser)
5           tron     bash     username PD       0:00      1 (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance)

Some common ones are as follows:

Resources - The cluster does not currently have the resources to fit your job in your selected partition.
Priority - The cluster has reserved resources for higher  priority jobs in your selected partition.
QOSMax*PerUser or QOSMax*PerUserLimit - The quality of service (QoS) your job is requesting to use has some limit per user (CPU, mem, GRES, etc.).  Use show_qos and show_partition_qos to identify the limit(s) and then use scontrol show job <jobid> for each of your jobs running in that QoS to see the resources they are currently consuming.
AssocGrpBilling - The SLURM account you are using has a limit on the overall billing amount available in total for the account.  Use sacctmgr show assoc account=<accountname> where user= to identify the limit, replacing <accountname> with the account you are submitting your job with.  You can see all jobs running under the account and their billing values by running squeue -A <accountname> -O "JobId:.18 ,Partition:.9 ,Name:.8 ,UserName:.8 ,StateCompact:.2 ,TimeUsed:.10 ,NumNodes:.6 ,ReasonList:45 ,tres-alloc:80". The billing value will be part of the tres-alloc string for each job.
ReqNodeNotAvail - None of the nodes that could run your job (based on requested partition/resources) currently have the resources to fit your job.  Alternatively, if you also see Reserved for maintenance, there is a reservation in place (often for a  maintenance window).  You can see the current reservations by running scontrol show reservation.  Often the culprit is that you have requested a TimeLimit that will conflict with the reservation.  You can either lower your TimeLimit such that the job will complete before the reservation begins, or leave your job to wait until the reservation completes.
SLURM's full list of reasons/explanations can be found here(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_reason_codes.html).

︗Java

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Java can be obtained in one of two flavors: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK). Unless you do programming in Java, JRE is usually sufficient for running programs and applets written in Java. JRE is also included in JDK so there is no need to install both.  There are two main flavors of Java that we have support for Oracle Java(The prior text links to http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/overview/index.html) and OpenJDK(The prior text links to http://openjdk.java.net/).

︗None
The version of Java running can be checked by running the following command on any RHEL/Ubuntu machine. Alternative JDK and JRE options can be found in /usr/lib/jvm. bash-4.2$ java -version
︗Windows
JRE is installed on all supported workstations by default and auto-updated to the latest version periodically. If for some reason your machine does not have Java, you may send a request to staff(The prior text links to mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu) to have JRE or JDK installed on your machine.

︗RHEL7

From UMIACS
(Redirected from RHEL)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Red Hat Enterprise Linux(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux) 7 is an operating system published by Red Hat, Inc., which is currently a subsidiary of IBM.

︗Contents

1 Features
2 Kernel and Performance
3 Virtualization
4 File System Capabilities
5 Security


︗Features
A summary of important improvements are listed below.

︗Kernel and Performance
Based on Linux 3.10.0-957 kernel.
Initial process is changed to systemd.
Includes Security-Enhanced Linux(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux).
︗Virtualization
Users can run virtual machines within RHEL 7 using its built-in Kernel-based Virtual Machine(The prior text links to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_getting_started_guide/chap-virtualization_getting_started-products), or KVM. UMIACS also supports the use of Apptainer, a container application that is an alternative to Docker.

︗File System Capabilities
The default file system is now XFS. Here is an overview of the supported file systems in RHEL7. The information in this section is taken from this Redhat page(The prior text links to https://access.redhat.com/articles/796293) unless otherwise noted.

XFS(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS)
"[RHEL7] supports XFS filesystem sizes of up to 500 TB."
"XFS supports journaling to minimize data loss in the event of a system crash. Journal data are written to the log section while the file system is active and read when the filesystem is mounted (to recover any data not already written to disk)."
ext4(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4)
"The maximum standalone filesystem size for ext4 filesystems...[is]...50 TB."
Btrfs(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs)
This an "an unsupported Technology Preview," and should be used with caution.
︗Security
In addition to the standard Linux security architecture, RHEL7 includes Security-Enhanced Linux(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux), a module which implements a mandatory access control(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) model. Tutorials for configuring SELinux in RHEL are available here(The prior text links to https://access.redhat.com/articles/217213).

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Windows_Activation contains the following information: 






︗Windows Activation

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
︗Windows Licensing
Windows uses an activation model for each UMD-licensed install. The installs will have to verify activation every 180 days. Activation and renewal is performed via the campus Key Management Server KMS, which is not available from off campus. For onsite desktops, this is not a problem. However, for laptops or home machines it poses a complication. As long as the laptop or home machine is periodically on the campus wireless or connects to the UMIACS or campus VPN, renewal activation will be performed automatically.
You must only use the below procedure on University owned hardware.
Please follow the below steps if you are receiving a message that your license is going to expire soon or that Windows is not activated.

︗Activation
Please note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN(The prior text links to https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/4010), or the  UMIACS VPN to activate. The below steps assume you have already established a network connection. Please also note that your time must be correct (i.e. set via the Internet) and set to the US Eastern timezone for this to work. You can try running w32tm /resync on the command line below in step 4 before running the other commands listed in that step to resync your time if the commands fail at first.

Click on the Start menu and type "cmd" in the run bar.
The image depicts a Windows 10 search interface, focusing on the search bar where the user has typed “cmd.” This search action reveals the “Best match” results on the left side, prominently highlighting the command prompt application (cmd) with a black icon beside the name. The title indicates it can be run as a command. Below the application title, there are several options: "Open," "Run as administrator," and "Open file location." 

In the background, the desktop shows various application icons like MATLAB, VLC media player, and others, suggesting a busy user environment. The overall color scheme is a combination of dark blues and whites typical of Windows 10, with a clean and modern layout. The taskbar at the bottom contains the Windows logo and application shortcuts, demonstrating a responsive, organized workspace. The emphasis on running CMD as administrator signals the need for elevated permissions, aligning with the context of following specific steps in the activation process outlined in the accompanying text.
Right-Click on the cmd button, and select "Run as Administrator" - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!
The image features the Windows 10 search interface prominently displaying the user interface where "cmd" has been entered into the search bar. On the left side of the screen, the results list identifies "cmd" (the Command Prompt) as the "Best match" with a black icon alongside. Below it, options to "Open," "Run as administrator," and "Open file location" are clearly visible, emphasizing the importance of elevated permissions for activation tasks.

In the background, the desktop environment displays multiple application icons, including MATLAB and VLC Media Player, indicating an active workspace. The desktop is primarily characterized by a modern color scheme featuring dark blues contrasted with white text, typical of Windows 10. The taskbar at the bottom is visible, showcasing the Windows logo and various application shortcuts, which enhances the organized nature of the user's digital environment. The overall layout reflects a clean, functional setup, where the user is likely preparing to execute command-line operations essential for the Windows activation process.
Select "Yes" if you get a prompt to allow the following program to make changes.
The image shows a User Account Control (UAC) dialog box from a Windows operating system. The box has a yellow-orange background, alerting the user to a security prompt. The dialog asks, "Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?" indicating that an action requiring administrative privileges is being initiated.

The title of the dialog box reads "User Account Control," while the app attempting to gain permissions is identified as "cmd.exe." Below this, it states, "Publisher: Unknown" and "File origin: Hard drive on this computer," implying that the command prompt application is being activated from the local system without verified origin credentials.

At the bottom of the dialog, there are two buttons: "Yes," on the left, which allows the operation to proceed, and "No," on the right, which would cancel the request. The option to "Show more details" is available, providing the user an opportunity to learn further about the application. The design aligns with typical Windows interface elements, emphasizing the importance of careful decision-making regarding software permissions.
From the Command Prompt, run these commands in order:
Windows 10/11:cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -skms kms.umd.edu:1688
cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -ipk NPPR9-FWDCX-D2C8J-H872K-2YT43
cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -ato
The image shows a Command Prompt window on a Windows operating system, highlighted with the header “Administrator: Command Prompt.” The text indicates the Windows version (10.0.18362.719) and includes the Microsoft copyright notice. The commands executed in the prompt are shown in sequential order, indicating steps taken for Windows activation.

1. The first command is `cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -skms kms.umd.edu:1688`, which sets the Key Management Service (KMS) address. Beneath this, a confirmation message indicates that the KMS machine has been set successfully.

2. The second command, `cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -ipk NPPR9-FWDCX-D2C8J-H872K-2YT43`, shows that a product key was installed successfully.

3. The third command, `cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -ato`, activates Windows, with a message confirming successful activation of the Enterprise edition.

The text is primarily white against a black background, representing typical Command Prompt aesthetics. The screen conveys a successful series of activation steps, essential for university-managed devices, with an overall sense of completion and functionality.
After these commands have run, the Key Management Server should have activated your Windows computer. You can also run: cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs -xpr to see when the current activation expires.
The image shows a Windows Script Host dialog box prominently displayed in a simple, white interface. The title bar identifies the dialog as “Windows Script Host,” indicating a system message related to software activation. Centered within the box is critical information: it specifies that the operating system is “Windows(R), Enterprise edition,” which confirms the version in use. Below this, a warning text states, “Volume activation will expire 5/8/2022 1:53:07 PM,” providing a clear deadline for users regarding the activation status.

The layout includes a single button labeled “OK” at the bottom right, encouraging the user to acknowledge the message. The overall color scheme is minimalistic, with black text against a light background, allowing for easy readability. The informational tone of the dialog suggests urgency for the user to address the activation issue before the specified expiration date, reflecting the necessity of compliance for continued use of the software.
If you are unable to activate, please see the message at the top of this section. If you are still unable to activate, and the computer you are attempting to activate is owned by the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, please contact  UMIACS staff with information about your problem. Otherwise, please contact the Division of IT(The prior text links to https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport).

︗Nexus/Vulcan

From UMIACS
(Redirected from Vulcan)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The compute nodes from Vulcan's previous standalone cluster have folded into Nexus as of the scheduled  maintenance window for August 2023 (Thursday 08/17/2023, 5-8pm).
The Nexus cluster already has a large pool of compute resources made possible through college-level funding for UMIACS and CSD faculty. Details on common nodes already in the cluster (Tron partition) can be found  here.
Please  contact staff with any questions or concerns.

7.1 Home Directories




︗Usage
You can SSH to nexusvulcan.umiacs.umd.edu to log in to a submission host.
If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:

nexusvulcan00.umiacs.umd.edu
nexusvulcan01.umiacs.umd.edu
All partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone Vulcan cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named vulcan in the standalone cluster (it is also named just vulcan in Nexus).
Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:



Standalone Vulcan cluster submission command

Nexus cluster submission command


srun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash

srun --partition=vulcan-dpart --qos=vulcan-medium --account=vulcan-abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bash


srun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bash

srun --partition=vulcan-cpu --qos=vulcan-cpu --account=vulcan --pty bash


srun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash

srun --partition=vulcan-scavenger --qos=vulcan-scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bash

Vulcan users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on Vulcan nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the vulcan-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all vulcan## in aggregate nodes plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan.
Please note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).

︗Nodes
There are currently 46  GPU nodes available running a mixture of NVIDIA RTX A6000, NVIDIA RTX A5000, NVIDIA RTX A4000, NVIDIA Quadro P6000, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, and NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards. There are also 4 CPU-only nodes available.
All nodes are scheduled with the SLURM resource manager.

︗Partitions
There are three partitions available to general Vulcan SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.

vulcan-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed. Only nodes with GPUs from architectures before NVIDIA's Ampere architecture(The prior text links to https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/) are included in this partition.
vulcan-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other vulcan- partitions are ready to be scheduled.
vulcan-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.
There are a few additional partitions available to subsets of Vulcan users based on specific requirements.

vulcan-ampere - This partition contains nodes with GPUs from NVIDIA's Ampere architecture(The prior text links to https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/). Job allocations are guaranteed.
As of Thursday 02/29/2024 at 12pm, there is a 4 hour time limit on interactive jobs in this partition. If you need to run longer jobs, you will need to modify your workflow into a job that can be submitted as a batch script.
As of Thursday 03/21/2024 at 5pm, there is a limit of 4 CPUs and 48G memory maximum per GPU requested by a job. If you need to run jobs with more CPUs/memory, you will either need to request more GPUs in the job or use a different partition.
Submission is restricted to the Slurm  accounts of the faculty who invested in these nodes:
Abhinav Shrivastava (vulcan-abhinav)
Jia-Bin Huang (vulcan-jbhuang)
Christopher Metzler (vulcan-metzler)
Matthias Zwicker (vulcan-zwicker)
︗Accounts
Vulcan has a base SLURM account vulcan which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in Vulcan compute infrastructure have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster.
If you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the vulcan account.  If your faculty sponsor has their own account, it is recommended to use that account for job submission.
The current faculty accounts are:

vulcan-abhinav
vulcan-djacobs
vulcan-jbhuang
vulcan-lsd
vulcan-metzler
vulcan-rama
vulcan-ramani
vulcan-yaser
vulcan-zwicker

Faculty can manage this list of users via our Directory application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/) in the Security Groups section.  The security group that controls access has the prefix vulcan_ and then the faculty username.  It will also list slurm://nexusctl.umiacs.umd.edu as the associated URI.
You can check your account associations by running the show_assoc command to see the accounts you are associated with.  Please  contact staff and include your faculty member in the conversation if you do not see the appropriate association.

You can also see the total number of Track-able Resources (TRES) allowed for each account by running the following command. Please make sure you give the appropriate account that you are looking for. As shown below, there is a concurrent limit of 64 total GPUs for all users not in a contributing faculty group.

$ sacctmgr show assoc account=vulcan format=user,account,qos,grptres

                  ...                                ...

︗QoS
You need to decide the QOS to submit with which will set a certain number of restrictions to your job.  If you do not specify a QoS when submitting your job using the --qos parameter, you will receive the vulcan-default QoS assuming you are using a Vulcan account.
The following sacctmgr command will list the current QOS.  Either the vulcan-default, vulcan-medium, or vulcan-high QOS is required for the vulcan-dpart partition.  Please note that only faculty accounts (see above) have access to the vulcan-high QoS.
The following example will show you the current limits that the QOS have. The output is truncated to show only relevant Vulcan QoS.

︗Storage
Vulcan has the following storage available.  Please also review UMIACS  Local Data Storage policies including any volume that is labeled as scratch.
Vulcan users can also request  Nexus project allocations.

︗Home Directories
You have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.
Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.
NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.

︗Scratch Directories
Scratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Vulcan compute infrastructure:

Network scratch directory
Local scratch directories
︗Network Scratch Directory
You have 300GB of scratch storage available at /vulcanscratch/<username>.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.
You may request a temporary increase of up to 500GB total space for a maximum of 120 days without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  Once the temporary increase period is over, you will be contacted and given a one-week window of opportunity to clean and secure your data before staff will forcibly remove data to get your space back under 300GB.  If you need space beyond 500GB or for longer than 120 days, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory.
This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.

︗Local Scratch Directories
Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage their data within the confine of their job and stage the data out before the end of their job.
These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month at 1am.  Different nodes will run the maintenance jobs on different days of the month to ensure the cluster is still highly available at all times.  Please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.

︗Datasets
We have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/vulcan-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.
The list of Vulcan datasets we currently host can be viewed here(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Vulcan).

︗Project Storage
Users within the Vulcan compute infrastructure can request project based allocations for up to 10TB for up to 180 days by  contacting staff with approval from the Vulcan faculty manager (Dr. Shrivastava).  These allocations will be available from /fs/vulcan-projects and /fs/cfar-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 180 days (requires re-approval from Dr. Shrivastava).

If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.
If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.
Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.

︗Object Storage
All Vulcan users can request project allocations in the UMIACS Object Store(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help). Please  contact staff with a short project name and the amount of storage you will need to get started.
To access this storage, you'll need to use a  S3 client or our UMobj command line utilities.
An example on how to use the umobj command line utilities can be found  here.  A full set of documentation for the utilities can be found on the umobj Gitlab page(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj).

︗Migration
︗Home Directories
The Nexus uses NFShomes home directories - if your UMIACS account was created before February 22nd, 2023, you were using /cfarhomes/<username> as your home directory on the standalone Vulcan cluster. While /cfarhomes is available on Nexus, your shell initialization scripts from it will not automatically load. Please copy over anything you need to your /nfshomes/<username> directory at your earliest convenience, as /cfarhomes will be retired in a two phase process:

Fri 11/17/2023, 5pm: cfarhomes directories are made read-only
Thu 12/21/2023, 5-8pm (monthly maintenance window): cfarhomes directories are taken offline

The NAGWare Fortran compiler is available under /opt/common/NAGWare_f95* on our supported RHEL7/Ubuntu hosts. You can either load the binaries into your environment using  GNU Modules, reference the paths directly, else add them to your  PATH.

︗Example use of the compiler
Here is a very basic compilation and execution example of Hello World(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program) using the NAGWare fortran compiler. This example will utilize a GNU Module available on all supported Linux hosts to quickly load the binaries and libraries into your environment. 
First, in a working directory, create a file hello.f95 with the following contents:

PRINT *, "Hello World!" 
END

Then, load the NAGWare modules into your environment and verify that the compiler is in your path (libraries, MANpages, and license server information will be loaded as well):

-bash-4.2$  module load nagware
-bash-4.2$  which f95
/opt/common/NAGWare_f95-5.1/bin/f95

Compile and then run the program:

-bash-4.2$  f95 -o hello hello.f95 
-bash-4.2$  ./hello 
 Hello World!

Jump to search
If you are migrating from Backup and Sync, please follow the migration steps  here.

︗Contents

1 Overview
2 Installation
3 Windows Setup
4 Mac Setup


︗Overview
Drive for desktop is an application for Windows and macOS that lets you quickly access Google Drive content directly from your operating system's file browser. Drive for desktop also automatically syncs local files and directories of your choosing to your Google Drive in the background. This allows you to continuously back up your data as you create or modify it on your local machine(s) without needing to manually upload each file to your Google Drive.
For Linux, you can set up Rclone(The prior text links to https://rclone.org/) with a cronjob to copy files to your Google Drive periodically. Instructions to do this can be found  here.

︗Installation
Drive for desktop can be downloaded here(The prior text links to https://www.google.com/drive/download).

The image shows a webpage from Google Drive, focused on promoting the Drive for Desktop application. At the top left, the Google Drive logo features a colorful triangular design. The main section contains a bold header stating, “Safely store your files and access them from any device,” conveying the software's convenience and security. Below the header, brief instructional text encourages users to choose folders to sync with Google Drive or back up to Google Photos.

Prominently displayed in the center is a blue button with the text "Download Drive for Desktop," highlighted with a circular red outline, drawing attention for visitors who wish to initiate the download. To the right, a graphical representation of the Drive interface is visible, showcasing folder organization and features related to syncing options. The design emphasizes user-friendliness, with clear labels such as “Google Photos” and options for managing content, presented in a clean, modern aesthetic. The overall color scheme is predominantly white, with blue accents, providing a professional and inviting appearance.

︗Background
From the main Project Page(The prior text links to http://www.latex-project.org):
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.

︗LaTeX on Windows
In Windows, it is highly recommended to use a full-featured suite such as TeX Live(The prior text links to https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or MiKTeX(The prior text links to http://miktex.org/). Both of these suites include everything required for end-to-end LaTeX compilation and filetype conversation. Please contact the HelpDesk for assistance with installing or using these on a UMIACS-supported Windows machine.

︗None
MacTeX(The prior text links to https://www.tug.org/mactex/) is available for macOS.
TeX Live(The prior text links to https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is available for Linux. For editing LaTeX files on RHEL7, Texmaker(The prior text links to https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) is available as a GNU module.
Most of our supported Linux systems come with the LaTeX command-line utilities, as well as TeX Live, installed. Supported RHEL7 workstations come with Tex Live 2013, but you can load a newer version of TeX Live as a GNU module.

︗Checking installed packages
TeX Live comes with tons of packages preinstalled. To get a list of installed packages, you must first load the TeX Live GNU module. You can then use the following command:

$ tlmgr list --only-installed
If you know which package you are looking for, you can pipe the output into grep to search for specific packages.

︗Compiling to PDF
The following is an example of compiling example.tex to a PDF.



    Compile the file into a DVI file by using the latex command.

    $ latex example.tex 
This is pdfTeX, Version 3.1415926-2.3-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2013)

︗Activation
There is no automated way to activate Mathematica across our domain. As a result, each computer will have to be registered once against our hosted license server. Any user can go through this process, and it should persist indefinitely so long as the computer is not reinstalled.

Upon being prompted, click "Other ways to activate" in the bottom row: The image displays a computer screen showing the activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10. The top of the window features a bold title in red, "Wolfram Mathematica 10," indicating the software version. The central area contains instructions to "Activate online" with a prompt that asks users to enter their "Activation Key." Below this, a text box is provided for inputting the key, labeled "Activation Key," with placeholder text displayed in parentheses suggesting the format of the key, which typically consists of alphanumeric characters.

At the bottom of the window, three buttons are visible. The first button, labeled "Quit," allows users to exit the activation process. The second button, highlighted with a bold arrow pointing to it, says "Other ways to activate," offering alternative methods for activation. The third button, labeled "Activate," is used to proceed with the activation once the key is entered. The overall layout is clean and user-friendly, with a professional aesthetic typical of software activation dialogs. The background appears light, allowing the text and buttons to stand out clearly.
Click "Connect to a network license server": The image depicts a software activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10, prominently featuring a bold title in red at the top that reads "Wolfram Mathematica 10." The window is divided into sections that guide users through the activation process. There are three primary activation methods listed:

1. **Online Activation (Recommended)**: This section indicates that the computer must be connected to the internet.
2. **Manual Activation**: This option is provided for users encountering issues with online activation.
3. **Connect to a network license server**: This section, highlighted with an arrow, notes that this method should be used if the user is on a network that supports MathLM, specifying that it is the network license server for the product.

At the bottom of the window, a "Quit" button is visible, allowing users to exit the activation window. The overall layout is clean and professional, with a light background ensuring text readability. The design is user-friendly, emphasizing ease of navigation through the activation steps.
Enter "licserv.umiacs.umd.edu" as the license server. Click "Activate": In the image, the activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10 is displayed prominently. The top of the window features a bold title in red, "Wolfram Mathematica 10," establishing the software version. Below the title, a section titled "Connect to a Network License Server" instructs users to enter the name or IP address of the server running the MathLM license server, specifically indicating a text box for input. The placeholder text within this box suggests entering "licserv.umiacs.umd.edu."

At the bottom of the window, there are three buttons: "Quit," which allows users to exit the activation process; "Other ways to activate," offering alternative activation methods; and the "Activate" button, highlighted with an arrow indicating its function to initiate the activation once the server name is entered. The layout of the window is user-friendly, with a light background that enhances readability, maintaining a professional aesthetic typical of software interfaces. The overall design facilitates easy navigation through the activation process.
Accept the terms, and click ok: The image shows a software activation window for Wolfram Mathematica 10, set against a light blue background. At the top, a bold title in red reads "Wolfram Mathematica 10," clearly indicating the software version. Below the title, instructions highlight the necessity of accepting the Mathematica License Agreement to proceed with the activation. The agreement text outlines important terms and conditions that users must acknowledge.

In the central part of the window, there is a checkbox labeled “I accept the terms of this agreement,” which the user must select to confirm their consent. Below this, there are three buttons aligned horizontally: on the left, the "Quit" button provides an option to exit the activation process; the middle button, labeled "Print," allows users to print the agreement for their records; and on the right, the "OK" button, highlighted to indicate its primary function, is for proceeding with the activation once the terms are accepted.

The overall design is clean and user-friendly, with a professional aesthetic typical for software dialog boxes, ensuring ease of navigation.
Mathematica should now be activated on the computer.

︗Creating service admin user on macOS

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
When taking an Apple product to the Terrapin Tech store(The prior text links to https://it.umd.edu/terrapin-tech), it is critical that you create a Service Admin User on your computer before having it serviced. The technicians at the store require an admin user name and password, and if the pre-existing password is the same as your UMIACS domain login password, revealing it to the technicians would represent a security vulnerability. To remedy this, you must create a new temporary user account with administrator privileges that the technicians can use to service your machine. 

︗Creating the new account
Make sure you are logged in to an administrator account on your MacBook.
Navigate to System Preferences. (Click on the Apple Logo at the top lefthand side of the screen, and select "System Preferences" from the dropdown menu.)
From the System Preferences menu, select "Users and Groups" .
On the righthand side of the screen where it lists the users currently on the machine, click on the 'Add User' button.
By default, the new account will be set to a Standard account. Select the "New User" dropdown menu and choose "Administrator" from the list.
The image displays a macOS interface for creating a new user account. At the top, there is a dropdown menu labeled "New User" where the option for "Administrator" is selected, indicating the type of access for this new account. Below this, there are several input fields for entering user details. 

The "Full Name" field is present for entering the user's complete name, while the "Account Name" field shows a descriptive note indicating its use as the name for the home folder. A "Password" field requires a password to be entered, accompanied by a reminder about the password requirements, specifying that it should be four characters or more. There is also a "Verify" field to re-enter the password for confirmation, along with an optional "Password Hint" field, recommended for user assistance.

At the bottom of the interface, there are two buttons: one labeled "Cancel" to terminate the account creation process, and another labeled "Create User" to finalize the new user account setup. The overall color scheme is dark, typical of macOS design elements, offering a sleek, modern aesthetic.
The new user's full name should be "Service Admin," and the account name should be "serviceadmin".
The password is up to you, so long as it's not the same as your UMIACS account password or your UMD Directory ID password.
The image displays a macOS user account creation interface, set against a primarily dark background consistent with Apple's design aesthetics. At the top of the interface, there is a dropdown labeled "New User," where the option "Administrator" is selected, indicating that the new account will have administrator privileges. Below this, the fields for user details are laid out clearly.

The "Full Name" field is populated with the name "Service Admin," intended for identifying the account. The "Account Name" field shows "serviceadmin", which will designate the account's folder. Each password field is represented with asterisks, indicating input for privacy. A note specifies the password requirements, stating that the password must consist of at least four characters. 

A "Verify" field follows, which requires re-entering the password. An optional "Password Hint" field is also presented, suggesting a hint for future password recovery assistance. At the bottom, two buttons are visible: "Cancel" for aborting the action and "Create User" to finalize the new account’s creation. The layout is clean and user-friendly, focusing on essential user setup tasks.
Select "Create User".
When prompted by the Terrapin Tech sore, you should give this account's credentials to the technician, not your UMIACS account credentials. Once the service is completed, the account can be deleted.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Docker contains the following information: 






︗Podman

From UMIACS
(Redirected from Docker)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Podman(The prior text links to https://podman.io/) is a daemonless container engine alternative to Docker(The prior text links to https://www.docker.com/).  We don't support Docker in many of our environments as it grants trivial administrative control over the host the Docker daemon runs on.  Podman on the other hand has the ability to run containers in user namespaces.  This means that for every user name space in the kernel you create the processes within it will map to a new uid/gid range.  For example, if you are root in your container, you will not be uid 0 outside the container, but instead you will be uid 4294000000.
We still believe that Apptainer is the best option for running containerized workloads on our clustered based resources.  Podman is a good option for developing the containers to be run via Apptainer or building a deliverable for a funding agency.  Please  contact staff if you would like Podman installed on a workstation or standalone server.  More information on Podman running rootless can be found here(The prior text links to https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md).

︗Contents

1 Getting Started

1.1 Storage


2 GPUs
3 Example


︗Getting Started
To get started there are a few things that you need to configure.
First, run the podman command.  If it says command not found or you get an ERRO like the one below about no subuid ranges, and you are on a workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server, please  contact staff with the error and the host that you are using.  We will need to do some steps to setup the host you want ready.

$ podman
ERRO[0000] cannot find mappings for user username: No subuid ranges found for user "username" in /etc/subuid
Error: missing command 'podman COMMAND'
Try 'podman --help' for more information.

︗Storage
Containers are made up of layers for the image and these are stored in the graphroot setting of ~/.config/containers/storage.conf which by default will be in your home directory.  With our home directories being available over NFS there is an issue(The prior text links to https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs) that due to the user name space mapping described above you will not be able to access your home directory when you are building the layers.
You need to update the graphroot setting to a local directory on the host.  The file ~/.config/containers/storage.conf may not exist until you run podman the first time, however you can manually create it.

[storage]
  driver = "vfs"
  graphroot = "/scratch0/username/.local/share/containers/storage"
...

When building larger images, it may fill up the default directory for imageCopyTmpDir (/var/tmp). If this happens, you will need to specify a different directory using the environment variable TMPDIR. For example:

export TMPDIR="/scratch0/example_tmp_directory"
︗GPUs
Running Podman with the local Nvidia GPUs requires some additional configuration steps that staff has to add to any individual workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server that runs Podman.  This includes ensuring the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed.
For example you can run nvidia-smi from within the official Nvidia CUDA containers with a command like this, optionally replacing the tag for different CUDA versions/OS images:

$ podman run --rm --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8 nvidia-smi

︗Example
To build your own image you can start from an example we have https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/gpudocker(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/gpudocker).
First clone the repository, change directory and build the image with podman.

git clone https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/derek/gpudocker.git
cd gpudocker
podman build -t gpudocker .

Then you can run the test script to verify.  Notice that we pass the local directory test as a path into the image so we can run a script.  This can also be useful for your data output data as well as if you write anywhere else in the container it will not be available outside the container.

$ podman run --volume `pwd`/test:/mnt --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d gpudocker python3 /mnt/test_torch.py
GPU found 0: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
tensor([[0.3479, 0.6594, 0.5791],
        [0.6065, 0.3415, 0.9328],

        [0.6611, 0.5361, 0.3212],
        [0.8574, 0.5116, 0.7021]])

If you instead want to push modifications to this example to your own container registry such that you can pull the container image down later, please see the README.md located in the example repository itself.

UMIACS  staff fully handles malware removal for any UMIACS-supported system you may use. However, depending on the malware that we believe your machine to have been infected with, it is possible that private information may have been collected by a third party over the course of the infection and could still be used to cause further harm to your work or you personally. The longer the malware had time to propagate, the greater the risk is that this is the case. If you are being directed to this page, it is likely the case that we have determined that you are at risk and we highly recommend you change all passwords for applications and websites you have visited while the machine you used was infected with the malware. In addition, if you made any online purchases whilst using an infected machine please be sure to keep a close eye on your credit card transactions for the next several weeks after the machine has been cleansed.
Below are a collection of links for changing passwords on commonly-used websites:

UMIACS(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/password)
UMD(The prior text links to https://directory.umd.edu/password)

LinkedIn(The prior text links to https://www.linkedin.com/uas/request-password-reset)
Lastly, please be sure to pay attention to the behavior of the previously infected machine whilst using it. If you notice any additional odd behavior or the behavior that originally tipped us off to the infection reoccurring it may be the case that we did not fully cleanse the system as we had hoped and you should email staff(The prior text links to mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu) or contact our HelpDesk ASAP so that we can further investigate.

︗PrinterQueueNaming

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
︗Printer Queues
UMIACS uses a centralized print server to manage all of the printers in the Institute.  See Printing for more details specific to your OS.  We have developed a naming scheme for our printer queues based on the colors the printer can produce, the type of queue, the building number, and the room number.
The naming scheme is as follows:

All color printers begin with a "c".  Black & white is the default so nothing extra is needed.
Then either "ps" for a PostScript-enabled queue or "pcl" for a Printer Command Language-enabled queue will appear.  PostScript and PCL are types of printer drivers.  If you are unsure what this means, use "ps" for PostScript.  PCL drivers may not always be available.
Then add the building number and a dash ("-"). E.g. add "432-" for IRB, "115-" for AVW, or "224-" for ATL.
Then add the room number. E.g. If the printer is in room 3208, add "3208".
The image displays a colorful and informative flowchart illustrating the naming convention for printer queues at UMIACS. The central text consists of "cps432-4208," represented in a vibrant gradient of blue, purple, and green colors. 

- **Color Indication**: The letter "c" in red signifies that this printer is a color printer. 
- **Driver Type**: Below this, “ps” in blue indicates the use of a PostScript or PCL driver. 
- **Building Number**: The "432" in purple denotes the building number, which is connected to a light purple arrow pointing upwards, indicating this signifies the building's identifier. 
- **Separator**: A dash (“-”) follows the building number, vividly drawn in purple.
- **Room Number**: “4208” in green represents the specific room number of the printer, accompanied by a green arrow pointing upwards, indicating that this segment defines the location of the room. 

These elements are visually emphasized with arrows, guiding the viewer through the components of the naming scheme, thereby conveying the systematic approach to organizing printer queues based on their characteristics and locations.

Some examples:

ps432-3208 is a black & white printer in Iribe 3208.
cps224-3261 is a color printer in Atlantic 3261.

︗OBJ/WebHosting

From UMIACS
(Redirected from Obj Website)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
UMIACS'  Object Store has the ability to host websites. On the settings page for each bucket, there is a section allowing you to specify a configuration for a website hosted in your bucket. You can choose keys located in your bucket to act as the index file (what will be displayed when someone visits your website) and the error file (what will be displayed when an error is encountered loading your website). These settings can be updated at any time.
Because hosting a website through your bucket requires others to have access to any keys associated with your website, setting up a website configuration will automatically set the visibility of your bucket to public and remove the bucket level ACLs. You will not be able to set the bucket back to private without first removing the website configuration, which can be done on the bucket settings page.
Note: The Object Store only has the capability to support static content and client-side scripting in bucket websites.

︗Hosting a Website
Hosting a website in OBJ is quite easy and can be done in a few simple steps. There are three different ways you can set up your OBJ bucket to host a static website.
First Method (Using the Web Interface):

Log into OBJ(The prior text links to https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/) and create a bucket. Make sure to choose a bucket name carefully since this will be part of the web URL. The image displays a user interface from the OBJ box, specifically the section for managing the "jayid-test" bucket. At the top of the screen, a white and light blue navigation bar indicates various functionalities like "Buckets," "Help," "Reports," and "Manage." Prominently featured in the center is the name of the bucket, "jayid-test," displayed in a bold font, implying a current selection or focus area.

Directly below this title, there's a search bar for locating files and folders within this bucket, indicating user-friendly navigation. The button labeled "Upload File" is highlighted with a bright orange circle, drawing attention to its importance. This button is likely used to initiate the uploading of files into the selected bucket, emphasizing functionality for users looking to manage content in their storage space. To the right of this button are additional options, including "New Directory" for creating folders and "Bucket Settings," suggesting organized management capabilities within the system. The overall aesthetic is clean and straightforward, designed to enhance user experience and accessibility.
Upload your index.html file and optional error.html file (and any other required files for your website) on the bucket that you just created.
Once the files are uploaded, click on Bucket Settings
On the settings page, click on the blue Make Public button. The image showcases a user interface from the OBJ platform, primarily focusing on the management of a bucket titled "jayid-test." At the top, a simple rectangular header displays the bucket name in large, bold text, indicating it is currently selected. Below this header, a vertical usage panel reveals that there are "0 objects" and "0 bytes" utilized in this bucket, along with the owner's name, "jayid07." 

Two arrows prominently indicate key actions: one pointing to the "Make Public" button, highlighted in blue, emphasizing the importance of changing the visibility settings. Below, there are fields for website hosting configuration, including "Key for Index file" where "index.html" is entered, and an optional field for the error page labeled "error.html." A "Submit" button is positioned beneath these fields, allowing users to finalize their settings. The right side of the interface contains instructional text explaining the implications of making the bucket public, stressing that this action will override existing Access Control Lists. The overall aesthetic is clean and organized, aimed at simplifying user interaction with the platform.
Under Website Hosting, enter the name of your index.html (and optionally error.html) file and hit Submit.

Second Method (Using the UMobj CLI):

Set up your environment variables.
On the shell enter mkobj <bucket_name> to create a bucket. Your bucket name must be unique. You can enter lsobj -l to see the existing buckets.
Copy all the required files to the bucket: cpobj [source_directory]/file_name <bucket_name>:. For example, cpobj /fs/www-users/jayid-test/index.html jayid-test:
Create a web configuration for your bucket:  webobj -m create -c website --index=index.html --error=error.html <bucket_name>
Make your bucket public: chobj -m public <bucket_name>
Third Method (Using a Graphical S3 Client):
Since there are many different graphical clients available, we won't be able to cover detailed instructions for all of them. The instruction below only applies to Cyberduck.

Please refer to S3Clients to download and install Cyberduck.
Log into Cyberduck using the instruction from the previous step.
Once logged in, right-click > New Folder.... Give a unique name to your bucket.
Right-click on the bucket you just created, and click on Upload.... You can upload multiple files at once.
Once all the files are uploaded, right-click on the same bucket, and click on info.
Under the Distribution (CDN) tab make sure to leave a checkmark next to Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.The image showcases a user interface from the Cyberduck application, specifically focusing on the settings for the bucket named "jayid-test." The panel is divided into sections with a clean layout, primarily in light colors, emphasizing readability. At the top, there is a header labeled "Info - jayid07," indicating the user's information associated with the bucket.

The key feature is the "Delivery Method" section, prominently stating "Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution," with a checkbox labeled "Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution" checked, indicating that this configuration is activated. Below this, the "Status Logging" section shows that logging is enabled with a hint that access logs are being recorded for the selected container.

Further down, there are fields labeled "Origin" and "CNAME," currently set as empty, suggesting they are optional or not utilized in this configuration. Finally, the "Index File Invalidation" section states the current index file as "index.html," with an option to invalidate cached files, indicating management capabilities over content delivery. The visual elements are arranged systematically to enhance user navigation and clarity in managing website settings.
Next, click on the drop-down menu next to Index File and select your index.html file (or whatever file you're using as your index file).
Under the Permission tab, add a permission by clicking on the cog icon on the bottom left and click on Everyone. Change the permission for Everyone to READ as shown on the image below.<The image showcases a user interface from a graphical file management application, likely a cloud storage service. It features a tabbed layout with a series of icons at the top for navigation, including "General," "Permissions," "Metadata," "Distribution (CDN)," and "S3." The focus is on the "Permissions" tab, where two tables are visible detailing the Access Control List (ACL) for a file named "index.html."

In the permissions table, the first row indicates a specific user, "Jayid Alam," who has been granted "FULL_CONTROL," giving them complete access to the file. The second row labeled "Everyone" shows a dropdown menu indicating that this group is granted "READ" permission, allowing all users to view the file without making changes. 

Two prominent red arrows point towards these rows, emphasizing the permissions and the importance of setting access levels adequately. Below the permissions table, a gray area suggests potential additional controls or features, though it remains empty. The overall color scheme is light, with dark text facilitating readability, making the interface user-friendly and intuitive for managing access settings effectively.
︗Accessing the Website
You can access the website by using the default URL which has the form https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io.

︗Setting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage
If you are intending to use the site as your personal UMIACS webpage, once the bucket is configured and all the required files are uploaded, please log into your UMIACS Directory page(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/info/) and update the Home Page attribute to https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io. Replace <Bucket_name> with the name of the bucket you created.
Afterwards, www.umiacs.umd.edu/~username will also redirect to your website.

︗Disabling a Website
If you no longer wish to host a website, you can disable the bucket's web configuration.
Using the web interface:

Click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and then click on Bucket Settings.
On the settings page you can, click on Remove Website Configuration. Alternatively, you can also click on the Make Private button to make your bucket private and remove any associated web configuration.
Using the CLI:
Enter the following command in the terminal: webobj -m delete -c website <bucket_name>
Using a Graphical S3 Client (Cyberduck):

Right-click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and click info.
Click on the Distribution (CDN) tab and uncheck the box Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.

Authentication to the Pulse Secure VPN will not be available during this migration window. Existing sessions will not be terminated, allowing you to continue using the VPN through the migration.  Two days prior to the migration, we will extend the default VPN session limit to 48 hours in order to minimize your disruption. If you require the VPN during this time please make sure you authenticate and maintain your connection before the outage window starts.
Windows workstations will be unavailable to log into during this migration window.
Exchange email access will be interrupted during this migration window.  Exchange email will be delivered however will not be accessible from phones, Outlook, or Outlook Web Access until after the migration has concluded.
︗After the migration has completed
We will post an announcement on https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu) when the migration has completed and will also send a follow-up email.
Your Windows account format will change from PC\username to UMIACS\username where you are required to specify a domain. You must use this username format going forward. Services that will require this new format:
Outlook Web Access for Exchange email users
Phone email setup for Exchange email users
Remote Desktop workstation access
Saved network drive(The prior text links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026635/windows-map-a-network-drive) credentials, which can be updated via Credential Manager(The prior text links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026814/windows-accessing-credential-manager)

︗Network/Troubleshooting

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Occasionally network related issues may arise.  The following outlines basic troubleshooting methods.

︗Contents

1 Check Network Connection
2 PING
3 Trace Route
4 Other Things to consider
5 Change your default DNS server


︗Check Network Connection
Check that the ethernet cable is plugged in or that you are connected to a wireless network.
Check that you have an IP address.
Windows: type ipconfig /all into the command prompt
macOS/Linux/UNIX based hosts: type ifconfig -a into a terminal
︗PING
PING is a network utility that sends ICMP packets to a specified host to test network connectivity.

Open up a command prompt / terminal and type ping followed by the hostname or IP address of the host you want to test connectivity to.
bash$ ping google.com
PING google.com (74.125.228.34) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from iad23s06-in-f2.1e100.net (74.125.228.34): icmp_seq=1 ttl=52 time=4.52 ms
64 bytes from iad23s06-in-f2.1e100.net (74.125.228.34): icmp_seq=2 ttl=52 time=4.17 ms
64 bytes from iad23s06-in-f2.1e100.net (74.125.228.34): icmp_seq=3 ttl=52 time=4.41 ms
64 bytes from iad23s06-in-f2.1e100.net (74.125.228.34): icmp_seq=4 ttl=52 time=4.04 ms

On Linux/UNIX, you may want to add the -c flag followed by a number to specify how many times to ping the destination host.
If you are having trouble connecting to UMIACS services, we would suggest you test against one of our publicly accessible Nexus hosts like nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu or nexuscfar00.umiacs.umd.edu.

-bash-4.2$ ping nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu
PING nexuscml00.umiacs.UMD.EDU (128.8.121.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.4): icmp_seq=1 ttl=60 time=0.507 ms
64 bytes from nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.4): icmp_seq=2 ttl=60 time=0.335 ms
64 bytes from nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.4): icmp_seq=3 ttl=60 time=0.328 ms
64 bytes from nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.4): icmp_seq=4 ttl=60 time=0.379 ms

︗Trace Route
The traceroute tool utilizes the IP protocol to track the route one's packets take through a network.  Traceroute is useful when trying to figure out why a host is unreachable because it shows where the connection failed.

Windows:
In a command prompt type "tracert" followed by the hostname or IP address of the host you want to test the route to.
C:\>tracert google.com
Tracing route to google.com [74.125.228.38]

Again, if you are having trouble connecting to UMIACS services, we would suggest you test against one of our publicly accessible Nexus host such as nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edu or nexuscfar00.umiacs.umd.edu.

︗Other Things to consider
Is your IP address manually set?
In order for networking to function properly, a machine must have a unique IP address on its network.  In many cases IP address are assigned automatically via the DHCP protocol, but it is also possible to manually set an IP address.  If your machine happens to have a manually set IP address that conflicts with that of another host, networking issues may arise.
Are you behind a firewall?
Some establishments use firewalls to restrict certain types of traffic both in and out of their networks.  If you are having trouble accessing a specific service, this might be the case.  To get around this you can connect to the VPN, or use SSH tunneling.
Other useful commands:
dig: performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried
host: simple utility for performing DNS lookups
netstat (macOS/Linux/UNIX): shows network status
route print (Windows): shows network routing tables
︗Change your default DNS server
Please see  DNS troubleshooting to change your default DNS server.

︗BashForWindows

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Microsoft has partnered with Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, to create a release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows Windows users to use Linux command line tools such as such as grep, sed, git on Windows files through Bash. 

︗Contents

1 Prerequisites
2 Installation
3 Use
4 External Links


︗Prerequisites
In order to install Bash/WSL, you must be running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 version 1607 or later, any version of Windows 11, or Windows Server 2019 or later. In Windows, open the Settings app > System > About to check if your Windows version is compatible. 

︗Installation
First, turn on Developer Mode, open the Settings app > Update & security > For developers > Select the Developer radio button
Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux, this can be done by turning on the feature through the Windows Features program or through a PowerShell session.
For the GUI method: Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off (this will require local administrator privileges > Check the box for Windows Subsystem on Linux
For PowerShell method (in an elevated/administrator session) use the command:  Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux 
Restart the system.
Open a command prompt or PowerShell session, and then run bash.
After accepting the license, the Ubuntu user mode image will be installed.
︗Use
Simply run bash in a command prompt or PowerShell session to enter bash. The first time Bash is installed on Windows, a prompt will appear to create a Unix user. This Unix user account is completely separate from the Windows user account and has  sudo  permissions on the WSL. There is no GUI that is installed, nor can be installed. 

The Linux installation is located at %localappdata%\lxss\, which is a hidden system folder. 

I'm ready to assist with detailed descriptions of images; however, I don't have the ability to see or process images at this moment. If you provide the images, I can help generate textual descriptions based on the information you provide.

Do not use Windows tools to edit the files or sub-files within this directory as corruption of the Linux files could occur.
 Windows storage and files can then be accessed from /mnt/..., such as /mnt/c/Users/myAccount.

︗Duo

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Duo(The prior text links to https://www.duo.com) is the multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution for both UMD centralized information technology resources (DivIT) and UMIACS local resources.  Multi-factor solutions ensure that you have something you know (i.e. your password) and something you have (phone/tablet/token) when trying to authenticate.  This ensures that phishing and other attempts to secure your password do not result in an account compromise and protect you and your data from unauthorized access.
Enrollment is discrete and must be done for both UMD (if you have a UMD appointment) and UMIACS individually.  You can enroll the same phone for both of these services, but not the same hardware token (if you use a token for UMD already).  The UMIACS Single Sign-On and our VPN require Duo authentication.
Do not share a registered Duo authentication factor with any other UMIACS user for any purpose. Action may be taken against your account if you do so.

The image depicts a user interface screen for a multi-factor authentication (MFA) process utilizing Duo. At the top, the heading "Other options to log in" is prominently displayed in bold red text, indicating alternative authentication methods available to users. Below this heading, various authentication options are listed in a clear, structured format.

1. **Duo Push**: The first option features an icon of a mobile device and instructs the user to send a push notification to an iOS device, obscured by "****" to protect sensitive information.

2. **Duo Mobile passcode**: This second entry includes an icon of a numeric display and prompts the user to enter a code generated by the Duo Mobile app.

3. **Text message passcode**: This option advises sending a passcode via text to an iOS device, similarly obscured.

4. **Phone call**: Next, this entry suggests calling the listed phone number (also obscured) associated with the iOS device for authentication.

5. **Bypass code**: The final option provides an instruction to enter a code obtained from the IT help desk.

At the bottom, a "Need help?" link is included, and "Secured by Duo" is noted, emphasizing the security infrastructure. The overall layout is functional and user-friendly, with icons and text organized for easy navigation. Duo Login Prompt

︗Enrollment
Please refer to Duo's Enrollment(The prior text links to https://guide.duo.com/enrollment) guide which has comprehensive information on how to enroll your devices.  Your initial sign in for enrollment purposes must be done via our Directory application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/auth/login).
We encourage users to enroll with their smart phone as it provides the most seamless experience.  We also support iOS/Android Tablets, landlines, and U2F FIDO(The prior text links to https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/) authenticator tokens (though these do not work with our VPN or MFA SSH services).

︗Management
Users can manage their UMIACS Duo settings as part of the required login to the Directory Application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/info).  Please follow the Duo guide for Managing Devices(The prior text links to https://guide.duo.com/manage-devices) when you see the Duo login prompt.
We suggest you register using a mobile phone or tablet that is always in your personal possession.  If/When you upgrade or dispose of your currently registered phone/tablet, please consider enrolling your new device before getting rid of your old device.  Activation of your new device will require you to successfully authenticate with a currently registered device.  If you no longer have the device but have kept the same phone number, you can select Call Me to have Duo call you to authenticate your session to manage/enroll your devices.  If you do not have access to your previous device(s) or the phone number, you will need to  contact staff for assistance.

︗Offline Use


The image displays a mobile interface for the Duo authentication application. At the top, the Duo logo is present, indicating the app's identity. Below it, details about the UMIACS service are shown, specifically the text “UMIACS” repeated prominently, suggesting that this account is tied to the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS).

The central focus is on a highlighted area containing a six-digit passcode, displayed as “229 711.” This passcode is essential for the authentication process, allowing users to securely log in to their UMIACS account. In a rectangular red outline, the word “Passcode” is labeled, emphasizing its importance. A "Copy" button is also visible, suggesting that users can easily copy the passcode for use elsewhere.

At the bottom is a refresh icon labeled “Refresh Passcode,” implying that users can generate a new passcode if needed. The overall dark background gives the design a sleek and modern look, promoting user engagement with the interface's functionality.

Duo Offline One-Time Code




The image presents a user interface screen for the Duo multi-factor authentication (MFA) process. The top section features a bold, red heading stating "Other options to log in," indicating the various methods users can select for authentication. Below this, five structured options are visible:

1. **Duo Push**: Accompanied by an icon of a mobile device, this option suggests sending a push notification to an iOS device.
2. **Duo Mobile passcode**: Highlighted with a red outline, users are instructed to enter a code generated by the Duo Mobile app. 
3. **Text message passcode**: This entry indicates sending a passcode via text to an iOS device.
4. **Phone call**: Suggests calling an obscured number associated with the iOS device for authentication.
5. **Bypass code**: Instructs users to enter a code obtained from the IT help desk.

The right side of the screen prompts users to "Enter your passcode" with a clear box, accompanied by a "Verify" button. A note at the bottom emphasizes the application's security, marked "Secured by Duo." The overall layout is clean and functional, designed for user-friendly navigation.

Entering Your Code




For use when phone data or calls are not available, there are 2 options. 
You may use the Duo App on their phone or tablet—without any internet connection—to generate one-time codes that will allow you to authenticate to Duo.  This code will be the input for the secondary login screen for the VPN or the passcode option in the Duo pane of web authentication.  To get a code from the app, open the app and tap on the entry labeled "Duo-protected UMIACS."  This will present a 6 digit passcode.
Alternatively, YubiKey hardware tokens can be used with Duo. Hardware tokens must be enrolled by the Technical staff, so if you are interested in procuring a hardware token for use with Duo, please  contact staff. We only support registering YubiKey tokens for this purpose, no other hardware token.

︗Services
The following UMIACS services are secured with our Duo MFA solution.

︗FAQ
I can no longer clone HTTPS Git repositories in GitLab. How do I work around this?
Since we now require more than just your username/password to log into GitLab, you cannot use your UMIACS credentials directly for accessing HTTPS Git repositories.  We encourage you to setup an SSH key(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/ssh/README.md#ssh) instead.  If you have a case where you need to use HTTPS, you can use a Personal Access Token(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md) to accomplish this.  Ensure that you create the token with API scope.  You would then use your username as normal and use the token as the password.  Treat this token as a personal secret, as it is sufficient to act as your account within GitLab.
How do I authenticate with a Token?
We only currently support YubiKey tokens for our Duo deployment.  You can follow the instructions from Yubico(The prior text links to https://guide.duo.com/tokens); you will need to tap the YubiKey once you select the Enter a Passcode field.  It will create a passcode (will look something like kffuastenhldrhfhadafdarivuntddugrvjvllddjjuget) and send a return.

︗Mailman List Administration
The full documentation can be found at (among other places) the Mailman administrators guide: http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/(The prior text links to http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/)
Once UMIACS staff has created your list, they will tell you what the password is for managing this list. You'll need this password to do various list management things such as add/remove users, approve user subscription or postings for restricted lists, and tailor the list.
If staff was provided with a list of initial subscribers, these people will have already been subscribed. Tell your users that if they'd like to subscribe, they need only go to

 http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME)

even if the list is private (not advertised or listed).
They can also subscribe/unsubscribe by email by sending to

 LISTNAME-subscribe and LISTNAME-unsubscribe

respectively. In ALL of the above cases, the user will receive email confirming their action. They need to just reply to the mail for this to take effect.

︗Managing a List
To manage your list, go to:

  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME)

You will be prompted for the aforementioned password. In general, most of the default settings are likely to be fine but you should know about the following capabilities and pieces of information.

Just because you are the list administrator doesn't mean you're subscribed to (or you have to be subscribed to) this list.
Messages sent out aren't necessarily delivered immediately; it could take up to 5 minutes.
︗Membership Management
  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/members(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/members)

This is where you can subscribe and unsubscribe users, hide their email addresses, and more.

To subscribe other people, on this form, enter their addresses in the text window under the "Mass Subscription" section. Please note that if the user you are adding has a UMD address, you should use that address in order to comply with the Institutional email standard(The prior text links to https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport/?sys_kb_id=6b102078dbbec8d06aa4151748961927&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=2&sysparm_tsqueryId=c11ba448db4788906aa4151748961904#institutional-email-standard).
If a user goes on vacation, you can change the option to "nomail" for them on this form turning off mailing to that individual until he/she returns. Of course, users can do this themselves as well.
If a user forgets their password, clicking on the user's email address on this form allows you to send them an email message containing their password.
︗Privacy options
  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/privacy(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/privacy)

This is where you can specify whether or not the list is visible to the world, whether or not administrative approval is required to subscribe to the list, who can view the list of subscribers, who can post to the list (is it open or moderated?), and more.

︗Archiving Options
  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/archive(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/LISTNAME/archive)

This is where you can choose whether or not to archive messages send to the list. By default, messages are archived and are available only to subscribers of the list using their subscribing password at  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/private/LISTNAME(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/private/LISTNAME). You can change this to make messages available to the public or turn off archiving entirely. Archives are not searchable.

︗General Settings
Most of the defaults for lists are probably fine but a number of them bear special mention. 
Options under Subscribing under "Privacy options":

By default, no one can see the list.
If this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the first item "Advertise this list when people ask what lists are on this machine?" from NO to YES, and then "Submit Your Changes" on the bottom of the page. Note that even if users can't see the list, they can still subscribe (or try to subscribe). They simply need to know the URL.
By default, anyone can subscribe to the list. (To ensure that someone can't subscribe someone else as a prank, Mailman sends a confirm email message to the users asking something like, "You have been subscribed to.... Are you sure you want to subscribe? Just REPLYing to this message will subscribe you").
If this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the second item "What steps are required for subscription?" and click "Require approval" or "Confirm and approve" and then "Submit Your Changes" on the bottom of the page. Approval means that you, as the list administrator, will get a message saying USER@HOST wants to subscribe. You can then approve or discard their request.
Option under Membership exposure under "Privacy options":

By default, only list members can see the email addresses of other list members. Users can hide their own addresses from their list subscription page. Likewise, you can hide some users and not others from the "Membership Management" page.
If you want to broadly change visibility for all users, change the setting on the first item "Who can view subscription list?" and click either "Anyone" or "List admin only" and then "Submit Your Changes" on the bottom of the page.
︗Moderated Lists
︗Setup
If you want your list to be moderated (i.e. ONLY you and/or a few others can post to it), this can be set at the bottom of the "Membership Management" --> "Membership List" page. Make sure to also set this for all new members under "Privacy options" --> "Sender filters". If moderation is set, make sure the list admin (and/or whomever you want to be able to send to the list) has their moderation bit turned off.
List admins can add moderators to a list by entering their email addresses in the "The list moderator email addresses. Multiple moderator addresses, each on separate line is okay." box on the "General Options" page of the list's admin interface:

The image displays a user interface for managing a mailing list, focusing specifically on the "General list personality" section of the Mailman application. The top of the layout is characterized by a light gray background. 

In the first box, labeled "The public name of this list (make case-changes only)," there is a blank input field where the user can enter the public name for the mailing list, indicating it can be changed but requires case sensitivity. Below that, the second box is designated for entering "The list administrator email addresses. Multiple administrator addresses, each on separate line is okay." There is also an empty text area next to this label for input. This emphasizes the capability to input multiple addresses efficiently.

The key focus of the image is the highlighted red box, which states, "The list moderator email addresses. Multiple moderator addresses, each on separate line is okay." This area includes a blank input field, allowing users to input the email addresses of moderators, indicating how administrators can manage moderation within the list. The presence of linked texts for "Details for moderator" suggests further guidance for the user. Overall, the layout is simple and functional, designed for ease of administrative tasks regarding email list management.
As soon as the first moderator is added to the list, a list admin should set the moderator password and communicate it to the initial moderator(s). This password can only be changed by a list admin. It does not give full administrative access to the list.

︗For list moderators
Moderators and administrators will receive an email similar to the following if a message is being held for moderation:

The image shows an email notification template for a mailing list administrator requesting approval for a message posting. The email is framed in a simple, clean design. At the top, it includes a brief directive, "As list administrator, your authorization is requested for the following mailing list posting:", indicating its purpose.

Beneath this header, specific details about the posting request are presented in a clear, organized manner. There are four labeled items: "List," which specifies the name of the mailing list as "Testlist@lists.umiacs.edu"; "From," indicating the sender's email address (not specified in the image); "Subject," which remains blank in this instance; and "Reason," stating "Post to moderated list."

At the bottom, the email encourages the administrator to take action, stating, "At your convenience, visit:" followed by a hyperlink to the administrative approval page. The overall tone is formal yet straightforward, designed to facilitate quick and easy administration of the moderated mailing list. The use of bullet points and clear separation of sections helps ensure readability and efficiency for the administrator.
The provided URL can also be visited at any time to view the queue of messages pending moderation:

  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admindb/LISTNAME(The prior text links to http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admindb/LISTNAME)

From here, if there are one or more messages pending moderation, you will see a summary of the messages broken down per-sender. Please note that the addresses in these screenshots are hidden for privacy, but will appear on the actual moderation page.
There are two ways messages from senders may appear on this interface, depending on whether or not the sender is a member of the list:

If the sender is a member of the list (but their moderation bit is on):
The image displays a user interface for a mailing list moderation system, showcasing a section labeled "From:" at the top. To the left, there's an area called "Action to take on all these held messages," which features four radio buttons for the options: Defer, Accept, Reject, and Discard. Below these options, there is a checkbox for "Preserve messages for the site administrator," along with another checkbox for "Forward messages (individually) to:" where an empty text field is provided for entering an email address.

The right side of the interface contains details of held messages. It includes a list format showing two messages, with hyperlinked message numbers for viewing each one individually. Each message entry reveals specific attributes such as "Subject," "Size," "Reason," and "Received" timestamp, presenting clear and organized information. Both messages have reasons listed as "Post to moderated list." The overall design is functional, facilitating easy navigation and efficient management of messages pending administrator action. The layout’s simplicity supports quick comprehension and decision-making for the list administrator.
If the sender is not a member of the list:
The image displays a user interface for a mailing list moderation system. At the left section, there are four radio buttons labeled "Defer," "Accept," "Reject," and "Discard," allowing the moderator to select an action for messages held for moderation. Below this, checkboxes are provided for "Preserve messages for the site administrator" and "Forward messages (individually) to:" with an accompanying empty text field for entering an email address. 

On the right side, the "From:" section details the source of the held message, showing specific information including the subject line labeled as "[1] Subject: After changing moderation settings." Additional details underline the size of the message (5603 bytes) and the reason for moderation, noted as "Post by non-member to a members-only list." The receipt timestamp is also included, indicating when the message was received (February 4, 2020, at 9:46:29 AM). A hyperlink at the bottom encourages users to click on the message number to view the individual message or all messages from that sender, facilitating efficient message management and decision-making for the moderator. The overall layout is clean and organized, emphasizing the functionality and clarity needed for effective list administration.
From these windows, you can choose an action (Defer, Accept, Reject, Discard) for all messages from a specific sender via the radio buttons in the left sub-window, or handle individual messages by clicking on the [#] hyperlinks next to each subject line.
The key difference between the two categories of held messages (from a moderated member vs. from a non-member) is how you can handle future messages from the respective senders in the future:

For moderated members, you can choose the "Clear this member's moderate flag" option in the window for that member to automatically allow future messages from them to the list.
For non-members, you can choose to either add the sender's email address to one of the automatic filters for non-members (Accept, Hold, Reject, or Discard) to automatically action their messages in the future. There is also an option to ban the sender's email address from subscribing to the list if you see fit.

Network File System(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) (NFS) is a integral part of how our UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems communicate with each other.  We utilize both NFSv2 and NFSv3 protocols and do not at this time provide support for NFSv4.  However, for v2 and v3 unlike CIFS they do not have any authentication other than IP based host authentication.  This means many of our core file systems are very restricted to who they can be mounted by.
For almost all our users, NFS volumes will be automatically mounted via the Automounter including almost all home directories, web, and ftp file systems.

︗Jira

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Jira(The prior text links to https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a request and bug tracker that UMIACS uses to provide our HelpDesk functionality to our users. It can be accessed here(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira).
It is a web based ticketing system that allows both users and staff to maintain greater control over their tickets and makes communication and resolution of issues a seamless process. 

︗Using Jira
Jira automatically creates accounts for UMIACS Account holders. If you have a UMIACS account, you can log in to Jira using the UMIACS Single Sign On service. Otherwise, when you email Jira, a ticket is created, and the email address your mail was sent from is added as a participant to the ticket -- this means that if you create a ticket using a non-UMIACS email address, you'll have to login to Jira using that email address to see the ticket.

︗If you have a UMIACS account
Simply login to Jira's Customer Portal(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/portal/) and select the UMIACS Single Sign On to login with your UMIACS credentials.

︗None
The first time you use a new email address to submit a ticket or are included as a participant on a ticket with a non-UMIACS email address, you will get an automated email containing a link to set a password for the newly-created Jira account. After you have set your full name and password, you can log in with this email address and password at the external user page(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/user/login?nosso). If you no longer have the automated email, you can also just go to the external user page, click Forgot your password?, and enter your email address as the username to set it.
The image displays a login interface for a Request Tracker system, designed to help users create an account. The top of the interface features a welcoming message that reads, "Welcome to Request Tracker!" Below this, there is an informative statement encouraging users to set a password for future logins.

The form includes three input fields. The first field labeled "Username" contains a partially obscured email address, formatted as "[username]@gmail.com," hinting at the user's contact. The second field prompts for the user's "Full name," which is currently empty, indicating that the user needs to input their information. The third field is titled "Password," which is also empty but includes a checkbox labeled "Show password" for clarity when entering a password.

At the bottom of the form, there is a blue button labeled "Save and continue," suggesting the next step in the registration process. The overall design is clean and straightforward, featuring a muted color palette that focuses user attention on the input fields. The interface is user-friendly, catering to individuals seeking to access the system for support or ticket management.

︗VS Code

From UMIACS
(Redirected from VScode)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Visual Studio (VS) Code(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a multi-platform source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be used with a variety of programming languages and can have its base functionality extended through extensions available via its marketplace(The prior text links to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). The base editor itself is free, but some extensions may require paid subscriptions.

︗Contents

1 Cluster Usage

1.1 Best Practices

1.1.1 Use only as a code editor
1.1.2 Do not open large files
1.1.3 Clean up when done




2 Common Issues


︗Cluster Usage
It can be convenient when using our SLURM computing clusters to open a connection to a VS Code Server(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server) session on the submission node(s) that you have access to via VS Code's Remote - SSH extension(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh). Steps to set this up can be found here(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_installation). Use your UMIACS username and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN)(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) of the submission node you want to connect to. Password authentication does not provide an option to save your password, so for convenience, you may want to set up an  SSH key.
For a list of active issues with the Remote - SSH extension, please see Microsoft's GitHub tracker here(The prior text links to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/labels/ssh).

︗Best Practices
Because of the multi-tenant nature of our submission nodes, using the Remote - SSH extension to connect to a VS Code Server running on a submission node can have adverse affects on other users simultaneously using the submission nodes if not properly managed. The following is a list of "best practices" that we ask you please follow to minimize the chance of impacting others on submission nodes. We have compiled the list through observation as well as through discussion with users.

︗Use only as a code editor
VS Code can perform many common file management operations, such as moving, copying, or deleting files or directories. However, the overhead of providing progress updates / status messages through VS Code's UI can cause load spikes that result in other processes on the submission node (both system-level and other users') slowing down. This is especially the case if operating on thousands to millions of small image or video files. In extreme cases, it can seem as though the submission node is wholly unresponsive.
The best way to combat this is to use VS Code as just a code editor as strictly as you can (meaning creating new and/or editing existing source code files only). Use standard command-line programs such as mv/cp/rm in VS Code's terminal window or a separate application's terminal window for local file management instead, or use the techniques advertised  here for larger data transfers between nodes.

︗Do not open large files
Files that you open in VS Code's text editor on a remote machine through the Remote - SSH extension are loaded entirely into RAM on the remote machine. Because of the persistence of VS Code Server processes, opening several unique files may result in them all remaining in RAM for extended periods of time even if you no longer have tabs open for them in the Tab Bar.
As such, please refrain from opening large files (more than a few MB) in VS Code itself on submission nodes. Either use a lighter-weight command-line based text editor such as vim(The prior text links to https://www.vim.org/) or otherwise on the submission node itself, or first  transfer the files that you would like to open to either a less-used remote machine or your local machine before opening them.
If you absolutely need to open one or more large files for a very brief period of time on a submission node, please clean up your server session on that node (see below section) as soon as possible when done.

︗Clean up when done
If you are done using VS Code for an extended period of time (several hours / overnight), consider manually killing your server session on the submission node when exiting. By default, VS Code Server will keep the processes used by your session active for a few hours after you disconnect, keeping the VS Code Server processes on the submission node you were using alive, despite no longer actively being used.
This can be done by opening the Command Palette(The prior text links to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching "Kill VS Code Server on Host...".

The image displays a user interface from Visual Studio Code (VS Code), specifically showing the Command Palette feature. At the top, there’s a search input field containing the text “Kill VS Code Server on Host…”, which indicates the user's intent to terminate the server session. Below this, the suggestion "Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host…" is highlighted, indicating it was recently used. The background is predominantly dark with blue accents that highlight selected elements, giving a sleek, modern appearance typical of code editing applications. The layout emphasizes ease of access to commands, which is crucial for developers managing multiple server sessions effectively. Overall, the interface illustrates a common action taken by users to manage resources in a remote coding environment, reflecting best practices in minimizing resource usage while maintaining efficiency in coding workflows.
Select the submission node you were using and click on it.

The image features a user interface element from Visual Studio Code (VS Code), specifically showcasing the search functionality within the Command Palette. Positioned at the top is a clear search input field, displaying the text "nexus," which indicates the user may be searching for a specific server to connect to. Below this input area, two suggestions appear: "00.umiacs.umd.edu" and "01.umiacs.umd.edu," both highlighted in blue against a dark background, suggesting they are viable options. The interface design emphasizes a modern aesthetic, with dark shades complemented by blue accents that enhance visibility, typical of developer tools. This arrangement facilitates quick access, making it easy for users to navigate and select submission nodes efficiently. The spatial relationship between the input field and the drop-down suggestions illustrates the interactive nature of VS Code, where users can quickly locate and connect to servers. Overall, the image encapsulates a functional aspect of remote server management, showcasing VS Code's utility in streamlining coding workflows for developers.
Wait a few seconds and you should get a message confirming the command went through.

The image depicts a notification panel from Visual Studio Code (VS Code), indicating a successful action taken by the user. The message displayed is "Killed VS Code Server on nexus," which confirms that the user terminated their server session on a specific node, identified as "00.umiacs.umd.edu." The text is set against a predominantly dark background, characteristic of VS Code's user interface, with blue text for the notification to draw attention. To the right, there is a prominent blue button labeled "Open Logs," suggesting an option for the user to access detailed logging information related to this action. Below the notification, the source is labeled as "Remote - SSH," indicating that this action was executed via the Remote - SSH extension of VS Code. The overall layout is clean and concise, emphasizing clarity in communicating important status updates to the user within a coding environment. This image illustrates an essential operation for managing remote development sessions effectively in VS Code.
The next time you connect to the same submission node, you will have a fresh VS Code session on it.

︗Common Issues
If you are having trouble SSH'ing to a submission node with VS Code, check if your home directory is full.

Connect to one of your Nexus submission nodes via SSH not using VS Code.
 Remote connect to a server
Navigate to your home directory. cd ~
Check if it is full. df -h .
If it is full (Avail 0), delete some files to free up at least ~100MB of space. Filesystem                                    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes   30G   30G     0 100% /fs/nfshomes
Try connecting with VS Code again.

︗Partitions
There are two partitions available to general CBCB SLURM users. You must specify one of these two partitions when submitting your job.

cbcb - This is the default partition. Job allocations on all nodes except those also in the cbcb-heng partition are guaranteed.
cbcb-interactive - This is a partition that only allows interactive jobs; you cannot submit jobs via sbatch to this partition. Job allocations are guaranteed.
There is one additional partition available solely to Dr. Heng Huang's sponsored accounts.

cbcb-heng - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Huang's purchased GPU nodes. Job allocations are guaranteed.
︗QoS
CBCB users have access to all of the  standard job QoSes in the cbcb and cbcb-heng partitions using the cbcb account.
The additional job QoSes for the cbcb and cbcb-heng partitions specifically are:

highmem: Allows for significantly increased memory to be allocated.
huge-long: Allows for longer jobs using higher overall resources.
Please note that the partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on the partition-specific nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use.
The only allowed job QoS for the cbcb-interactive partition is:

interactive: Allows for 4 CPU / 128G mem jobs up to 12 hours in length - can only be used via srun or salloc.
︗Jobs
You will need to specify --partition=cbcb and --account=cbcb to be able to submit jobs to the CBCB partition.

︗Storage
CBCB still has its current storage(The prior text links to https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/cbcb-private/index.php/Storage) allocation in place.  All data filesystems that were available in the standalone CBCB cluster are also available in Nexus.  Please note about the change in your home directory in the migration section below.
CBCB users can also request  Nexus project allocations.

︗Migration
︗None
CBCB's standalone cluster submission and compute nodes were running RHEL7.  Nexus is exclusively running RHEL8, so any software you may have compiled may need to be re-compiled to work correctly in this new environment.  The CBCB module tree(The prior text links to https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/cbcb/index.php/CBCB_Software_Modules) for RHEL8 may not yet be fully populated with RHEL8 software.  If you do not see the modules you need, please reach out to the CBCB software maintainers(The prior text links to https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/cbcb/index.php/CBCB_Software_Modules#Contact).

︗KVM

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although work is underway to get the required changes upstream.
Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.
The kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux as of 2.6.20.
The system image for the virtual machine should be on local disk space.  Putting a running virtual machine on networked file space will result in poor performance for both the virtual machine, as well as other users of the filespace.

︗Contents

1 Getting Started
2 Creating a virtual machine

2.1 Initializing the machine
2.2 Forwarding Ports
2.3 Windows Example




︗Getting Started
In order to start using KVM on your machine, UMIACS Staff will first need to install the requisite packages and set a baseline configuration.  Please  contact staff along with a brief explanation of your goals for running a local virtual machine.  Note: Ubuntu requires you to be in the kvm group on the local host.
Once staff has installed the required packages you can then use the program 'virt-manager' to initialize and manager your virtual machines.

In a terminal run:
virt-manager -c qemu:///session
This will bring up a graphical interface which can be used to manage various aspects of your virtual machines.  The network that is available is called usermode networking which provides a NAT connection to the outside world.  See below about forwarding ports using qemu-kvm.
︗Creating a virtual machine
︗Initializing the machine
In virt-manager, highlight 'localhost' and then click the 'New' button.  This will bring up a new window that will guide you through configuring your virtual machine.  For the most part, you should stick with the default options.

︗Forwarding Ports
This functionality is only available by editing the XML file for your domain directly.  Libvirt(The prior text links to http://libvirt.org/drvqemu.html#qemucommand) has the capability to pass arguments directly to the qemu binary.  First create your VM with virt-manager and then shut it down.  Run in a shell virsh -c qemu:///session which will drop you into the virsh shell.   You can list your VMs both running and off by typing list --all.  Find the name of the VM and type edit NAME where NAME is the name of the VM.
You need to replace the <domain> tag in the first line to:

   <domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>

Then you need to insert the following lines directly above the last line which should have the </domain> tag.  In this case the port 2222 will be forwarded to the port 22.   You may specify multiple ports here but each needs its own -redir line and the port specifications.

   <qemu:commandline>
      <qemu:arg value='-redir'/>
      <qemu:arg value='tcp:2222::22'/>
    </qemu:commandline>

Here is an example forwarding 3389 to 3389 (RDP) when running Windows (you may need to activate RDP within your Windows VM).

   <qemu:commandline>
      <qemu:arg value='-redir'/>
      <qemu:arg value='tcp:3389::3389'/>
    </qemu:commandline>

︗Windows Example
You can start a windows install with virt-install in a rather automated fashion.  Here is an example using a Windows 10 x64 ISO with 40G disk and 16GB of RAM. Please note that this should spawn virt-viewer automatically and show you the Windows installer screen.

virt-install --connect qemu:///session --name=win10 --os-type=windows --network user --disk path=/scratch0/username/win10.img,size=40 --cdrom=/scratch0/username/Win10x64.iso --graphics spice --ram=16384

︗AddingUMIACSCertificateAuthority

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
︗Contents

1 Introduction
2 Windows
3 Safari and Google Chrome (macOS)
4 Other Browsers (Unix)


︗Introduction
When you visit webpages encrypted with SSL, you may be presented with a warning about the site's security certificate not being trusted. These are normally important screens to pay attention to on the internet as a whole and UMIACS goes to great lengths to maintain a secure environment for our users.  However, it is not cost effective to provide commercial certs for all our public facing certificates.  In order to keep costs down we provide a UMIACS CA (certificate authority) that enables your web browser to trust our secure webpages. The following steps explain how to import this certificate based on your preferred web browser.

︗Windows
For most Windows browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer), certificate authorities are handled by Windows itself. These are the steps required to accept the certificate:

Click UMIACS Certificate Authority(The prior text links to https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/images/7/7d/CA-cert.crt) to download the file.
Open the file and click "Install Certificate".
The image displays a Windows certificate information dialog box. The window is rectangular, featuring a white background with a gray title bar at the top. It includes an error message, indicated by a triangular warning icon with an exclamation mark, stating, "This CA Root certificate is not trusted. To enable trust, install this certificate in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store." 

Key details in the dialog box show the certificate's information: it is issued to "UMIACS Certificate Authority" and also issued by the same authority. The validity dates range from September 19, 2016, to September 17, 2026. The content is organized into sections such as "General," "Details," and "Certification Path."

At the bottom of the dialog, a prominent button labeled "Install Certificates…" is highlighted with an arrow pointing to it, indicating the next action the user should take. The button is distinctly larger than other text elements, drawing attention to the importance of installing the certificate. The overall layout emphasizes the need for user action to resolve trust issues with the certificate.
In the dialog box opened, click "Next".
Choose "Place all certificates in the following store".
Choose "Browse", in the dialog box opened, Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".
The image depicts a user interface for the Certificate Import Wizard on a Windows system, designed for importing digital certificates. The wizard is presented in a rectangular window featuring a light gray background. The left side displays the main instruction, "Certificate Store," indicating areas where certificates are managed. 

On the left half, a radio button is selected next to "Place all certificates in the following store," directing user action. Below, a text box labeled "Certificate store" is empty, accompanied by a prominent blue button labeled "Browse…," visually emphasized by an arrow pointing at it. This element signifies the next step in the process. 

To the right, a secondary window titled "Select Certificate Store" showcases a hierarchical view of various storage options for certificates. The folder labeled "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" is highlighted, indicating it is the selected destination for the new certificate. Below this selection, a blue button labeled "OK," with another arrow pointing at it, indicates the action to confirm the certificate's storage location, emphasizing the importance of this decision. The overall layout neatly organizes information to guide users through the certificate installation process.
Click "Next" and then "Finish".
If you get a Security Warning asking if you want to install this certificate, click "Yes".
The image shows a Windows Security Warning dialog box that is displayed when a user attempts to install a certificate from a certificate authority. The window has a rectangular shape with a white background and a yellow warning triangle icon featuring an exclamation mark, signaling caution. The primary text alerts the user about the risks of installing the certificate, stating: "You are about to install a certificate from a certification authority (CA) claiming to represent: UMIACS Certificate Authority." It emphasizes that Windows cannot validate the certificate’s authenticity and instructs users to confirm its origin by contacting the authority.

Key details about the certificate are provided beneath the warning, including a thumbprint identifier.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/UNIXDataPolicies contains the following information: 






︗LocalDataStorage

From UMIACS
(Redirected from UNIXDataPolicies)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
UMIACS recommends that any and all important data be stored on a redundant, backed-up file server.  However, there are a number of cases where this is not feasible.

︗Contents

1 Windows Local Storage
2 UNIX Remote Storage
3 UNIX Local Storage
4 Locally Attached Storage
5 Network Scratch Storage
6 UNIX Storage Commands


︗Windows Local Storage
Windows hosts at UMIACS store user directories on their local C drives. Supported, UMIACS-managed hosts automatically back up user data on the C drive nightly using the Institute's backup system. If you have a supported, UMIACS-managed host that has other internal or external hard drives attached to it, or partitions other than C on its primary hard drive, please be aware that these drives/partitions are not backed up. Laptops and non-standard hosts are not automatically backed up and should be manually backed up by their users.

︗UNIX Remote Storage
We provide storage to each of our users in our UNIX offerings through the NFShomes.
This home directory,

   /nfshomes/username

is backed up nightly into our TSM backup system.  This volume has Snapshots enabled for easy user restores.
Users are given a 30GB Quota. This quota is non-expandable and you will need to use either local or other network storage for increased space.

︗UNIX Local Storage
UNIX machines use redundant, backed-up network file shares for user directories.  Research data storage is also stored on redundant, backed-up network file shares and is generally available under /fs/
All UNIX machines also have local storage available for transitory use.  These directories may be used to store temporary, local COPIES of data that is permanently stored elsewhere or as a staging point for output.
These directories may not, under any circumstances, be used as permanent storage for unique, important data.  UMIACS staff cannot recover damaged or deleted data from these directories and will not be responsible for data loss if they are misused. Additionally, on our SLURM compute clusters, these volumes may have an automated cleanup routine that will delete unmodified data after some number of days. You can check the page for the specific cluster you are using for more information.
Please note that /tmp in particular is at risk for data loss or corruption as that directory is regularly used by system processes and services for temporary storage.
These directories include:

 - /tmp
 - /scratch0, /scratch1, ... (/scratch#)
 - any directory named in whole or in part "tmp", "temp", or "scratch".

︗Locally Attached Storage
Locally attached storage like USB flash drives and USB hard drives are very popular.  However, these devices are significantly more vulnerable to data loss or theft than internal or networked data storage.  In general, UMIACS discourages the use of locally attached network storage when any other option is available.  Please note that these devices are prone to high rates of failure and additional steps should be taken to ensure that the data is backed up and that critical or confidential data is not lost or stolen.

︗Network Scratch Storage
Some labs have network-attached storage dedicated for scratch/temporary storage. These shares are named in the same manner as local scratch or temporary storage (i.e. /fs/lab-scratch or /lab/scratch0) and are subject to the same policies as local scratch/tmp (discussed above.)

︗UNIX Storage Commands
Below are a few different CLI commands that may prove useful for monitoring your storage usage and performance. For additional information, run [command] --help or man [command]
df - Shows descriptive file system information

Usage: df [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides,
or all file systems by default.

du - Shows disk usage of specific files. Use the -d flag for better depth control.

Usage: du [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  or:  du [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
Summarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.

free - Shows current memory(RAM) usage. Use the -h flag for a human readable format.

Usage:
 free [options]

quota - Shows quota information, this is useful for viewing per filesystem limits in places such as a home directory. 

quota: Usage: quota [-guqvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat]
	quota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -u username ...
	quota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -g groupname ...
	quota [-qvswugQm] [-F quotaformat] -f filesystem ...

iostat - Shows drive utilization, as well as other utilizations. Pair this with the watch command for regular updates. 

Usage: iostat [ options ] [ <interval> [ <count> ] ]
Options are:
[ -c ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -N ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ]
[ -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } ]
[ [ -T ] -g <group_name> ] [ -p [ <device> [,...] | ALL ] ]
[ <device> [...] | ALL ]

︗SecureCopy

From UMIACS
(Redirected from SCP)


Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Secure Copy (or SCP(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) is a way of copying data between two computers using SSH.

︗Using SCP
SCP (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to securely copy files and directories between two locations. The following commands work under Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and macOS. 
This command, when run from a terminal, will copy the file "source_file0.txt" from the local machine to the home directory of nexusstaff00 and give it the name "target_file0.txt".

[jayid07@dedsec ~]$ scp source_file.txt jayid07@nexusstaff00:target_file.txt

This command, when run from a terminal, will copy the file "source_file1.txt" from the user's NFS homedirectory on nexustaff00 into the current local directory and give it the name "target_file1.txt".

[jayid07@dedsec ~]$ scp jayid07@nexusstaff00.umiacs.umd.edu:source_file1.txt target_file1.txt

Note how the syntax of scp is very similar to that of the UNIX command cp with the addition of a hostname and username.
For UMIACS supported Windows hosts, WinSCP (available for download here(The prior text links to http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)) is already installed.

︗Data Transfer

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Depending on the amount of data you are trying to transfer there are different commands that you should use.  The classic cp command has a number of edge cases in which it will not copy everything that is expected, so the only time that one should use the cp command is if the copy can be verified, such as if you are moving a single file. The better choice for transferring data is by using tar or gtar.  After transferring files or directories, you can use rsync to check that everything moved correctly and to perform a final sync on changed files.

︗Contents

1 Transfer a single file
2 Transfer a directory or large amounts of data to another location

2.1 Transfer between two different hosts


3 Verifying transfer


︗Transfer a single file
If you want to transfer a single file into another directory you can use the cp command.  The format for the cp command is: cp Source Destination. If destination is omitted, it will make a copy of the file(s) in the current directory.

To copy the file foo.txt into your home directory's Documents directory
cp foo.txt ~/Documents
To transfer the file foo.txt from your current directory to another host use scp (secure copy) with <USERNAME>@<FQDN>:<PATH>
scp foo.txt USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/Documents
This command will copy the file foo from your current directory to the folder Documents located in your home directory on the host example1. 

To transfer back the file foo.txt from the host example1 to another directory in your current host
scp USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/Documents/foo.txt ~/Videos
Important: The cp command should only be used for small file transfers.  If you try to transfer a large amount it is possible that cp will not copy all the files over properly. To learn more about the cp command type man cp on the in the terminal.

︗Transfer a directory or large amounts of data to another location
If you want to transfer a whole directory or a large amount of data to another location you can use the gtar command.

To combine two files in your current directory in an archive: gtar -cpvf archive.tar file1 file2
To re-archive the data back in a different directory, for example Documents in your home directory: gtar -C ~/Documents/ -xpvf archive.tar
This command will archive all files (including those in subdirectories) within the current directory and re-create the files in the directory that you specify.
The format for the gtar command for data transfer is:

gtar -cpf -  . | gtar -C /dir -xpvf -
In this command, the target is a dash '-' which stands for standard output, and the source is a period '.' which is interpreted as all files in your current directory. The standard output is piped to the second command, which has as a source a dash '-' (which the shell interprets as standard input). The output of the first command is piped and becomes the input of the second command. The target directory in your second command is /dir. 

To transfer all files from your documents to a folder in your home directory called foo: cd ~/Documents
gtar -cpf - . | gtar -C ~/foo -xpvf -
When you use this command it will display a list of the files it has transferred.
This command will leave Documents the same, but create a full copy of all files and folders from Documents in foo.
Note: This command will preserve permissions, attributes, and meta-data of all files transferred.

︗Transfer between two different hosts
To transfer files from the tmp directory on example1.umiacs.umd.edu to the foo directory on your current host:
ssh USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu gtar -cpf - /tmp | gtar -C /foo -xpvf -
To transfer files from foo directory on your current host to the tmp directory on example1.umiacs.umd.edu:
gtar -cpf - /foo/ | ssh USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu gtar -C /tmp -xpvf -
If your data transfer is interrupted, you can use the rsync command listed below to copy the rest of the files without creating doubles of files that have already been transferred.
rsync can also be used for the initial transfer of data if you expect the transfer to be interrupted.  Otherwise, this method should not be used as it takes more time and memory.
To run rsync to copy files, the format for the command is the same as written below under "Verifying transfer."

︗Verifying transfer
To verify that your transfer copied everything you can use the rsync command, which will compare the two directories' contents and will update the files in which it sees differences.
The format for the rsync command is:

rsync -aH /source/ /target
To ensure that the files are the same in Documents and foo from the previous example:

rsync -aH ~/Documents/ ~/foo
This command will compare the files and directories within Documents to the files and directories within foo.  If there are files within Documents and its subdirectories that do not appear in foo, this command will copy the missing files from Documents to foo.
Important: Make sure to include the slash after the name of the source directory, if you do not include it, it will copy the directory folder over as well.

︗MonthlyMaintenanceWindow

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
 UMIACS staff takes a monthly maintenance window to patch and reboot all UMIACS-supported hosts and services.  This provides a way to ensure security updates are installed and activated on the numerous different platforms and appliances that we maintain.
The window for each month is calculated by adding 9 days to Microsoft's Patch Tuesday(The prior text links to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday) to allow us to marshal patches released that month from Microsoft, Red Hat, Apple, and other OS and application vendors and have enough time to get our systems prepared to reboot.  This translates to the window being on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month.  The window lasts from 5pm-8pm.
Nexus will always have a reservation in place from 4:45pm-8pm on the day of the upcoming window to prevent jobs from being scheduled on compute nodes for the entirety of said window as well as 15 minutes before, to allow jobs to fully end. Any job submitted before the reservation begins that has a time limit that would run into the reservation will be held until at least the end of the reservation (8pm on the day of the window). This is to prevent issues with jobs failing to end properly causing delays in work we have scheduled during the window.
A list of upcoming maintenance windows is as follows, with the next one in bold. Again, the window is on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month, and lasts from 5pm-8pm.

︗Windows Patch Management

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
In order to combat the ever increasing number of 3rd party security vulnerabilities on Windows machines, UMIACS staff has deployed Ivanti Security and Compliance Manager. As security threats have evolved from the operating system to applications we have had to take this step in order to maintain operational security for the Institute. Currently the updates are focused on applications that are exposed to the internet such as web browsers, teleconferencing solutions, Adobe Flash, Java, etc.
Ivanti is currently deployed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as  Enterprise supported Windows laptops and home machines.

︗Automated Scanning
Patches are deployed during the week leading up to the maintenance window. Specifically, they will always be released on the Wednesday that falls between the 9th and the 15th of every month, and typically in the morning.

Desktops will scan for updates to be installed every night sometime between 7pm and 9pm. If you are not logged in during those times, the system will automatically install the patches and reboot if necessary. If you remain active on your system during those times, you will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.
Laptops will scan for updates to be installed at least once every day (assuming the laptop is powered on). This will only occur when the laptop has an active Internet connection (wired or wireless). You will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.
Installation can be deferred until lock/logoff if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, installation will automatically proceed:

Desktops: 24 hours
Laptops: 3 hours
If a reboot is required after installation finishes, you will receive another pop up. It is highly suggested to reboot right away due to system instability and vulnerability. However, reboot can be deferred for up to 6 days if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, the machine will automatically reboot:

Desktops: 24 hours
Laptops: 9 hours
If you interrupt the installation process between when the first patch begins installing and when the last patch finishes installing, Ivanti may ask to reboot before continuing to install the remaining patches next time it pops up. This is by design. If you would like to avoid multiple reboots on a machine that is used intermittently (such as a laptop), we would recommend starting a manual scan just before you stop using the machine for the night and then letting the machine download and apply all patches overnight. See below section for how to do this.

︗Manual Scanning
This should only need to be done on laptops or home machines in the event that Ivanti has not had a large enough time window to scan your computer recently, but can be optionally done if you see fit. Please note you will need an active Internet connection for this to work, however you do not need to be on the UMIACS VPN.

Search for "Security Scan" from the Start menu and click the result that shows up (should show a shield icon). The scan will begin. Patches will be detected and downloaded.
Note: The scan may fail on the "Checking for other running scanners" step if Ivanti is already running an invisible scan in the background. If this occurs, wait 10-15 minutes and then retry the scan.
The image depicts the Windows search interface. At the top, the title "Security Scan" is highlighted as the "Best match," indicating that it’s a desktop application. The icon next to it is a shield, symbolizing security or protection. Below this, there is a list of search suggestions, each featuring variations of the search term "security scan." Entries include terms like "security scanner," "security scanning," and "security scan free," suggesting different options related to security scanning tools. 

The overall color palette of the interface reflects the typical Windows aesthetic, with a light background and dark text for readability.

〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/LocalDataStorage contains the following information: 






︗LocalDataStorage

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
UMIACS recommends that any and all important data be stored on a redundant, backed-up file server.  However, there are a number of cases where this is not feasible.

︗Contents

1 Windows Local Storage
2 UNIX Remote Storage
3 UNIX Local Storage
4 Locally Attached Storage
5 Network Scratch Storage
6 UNIX Storage Commands


︗Windows Local Storage
Windows hosts at UMIACS store user directories on their local C drives. Supported, UMIACS-managed hosts automatically back up user data on the C drive nightly using the Institute's backup system. If you have a supported, UMIACS-managed host that has other internal or external hard drives attached to it, or partitions other than C on its primary hard drive, please be aware that these drives/partitions are not backed up. Laptops and non-standard hosts are not automatically backed up and should be manually backed up by their users.

︗UNIX Remote Storage
We provide storage to each of our users in our UNIX offerings through the NFShomes.
This home directory,

   /nfshomes/username

is backed up nightly into our TSM backup system.  This volume has Snapshots enabled for easy user restores.
Users are given a 30GB Quota. This quota is non-expandable and you will need to use either local or other network storage for increased space.

︗UNIX Local Storage
UNIX machines use redundant, backed-up network file shares for user directories.  Research data storage is also stored on redundant, backed-up network file shares and is generally available under /fs/
All UNIX machines also have local storage available for transitory use.  These directories may be used to store temporary, local COPIES of data that is permanently stored elsewhere or as a staging point for output.
These directories may not, under any circumstances, be used as permanent storage for unique, important data.  UMIACS staff cannot recover damaged or deleted data from these directories and will not be responsible for data loss if they are misused. Additionally, on our SLURM compute clusters, these volumes may have an automated cleanup routine that will delete unmodified data after some number of days. You can check the page for the specific cluster you are using for more information.
Please note that /tmp in particular is at risk for data loss or corruption as that directory is regularly used by system processes and services for temporary storage.
These directories include:

 - /tmp
 - /scratch0, /scratch1, ... (/scratch#)
 - any directory named in whole or in part "tmp", "temp", or "scratch".

︗Locally Attached Storage
Locally attached storage like USB flash drives and USB hard drives are very popular.  However, these devices are significantly more vulnerable to data loss or theft than internal or networked data storage.  In general, UMIACS discourages the use of locally attached network storage when any other option is available.  Please note that these devices are prone to high rates of failure and additional steps should be taken to ensure that the data is backed up and that critical or confidential data is not lost or stolen.

︗Network Scratch Storage
Some labs have network-attached storage dedicated for scratch/temporary storage. These shares are named in the same manner as local scratch or temporary storage (i.e. /fs/lab-scratch or /lab/scratch0) and are subject to the same policies as local scratch/tmp (discussed above.)

︗UNIX Storage Commands
Below are a few different CLI commands that may prove useful for monitoring your storage usage and performance. For additional information, run [command] --help or man [command]
df - Shows descriptive file system information

Usage: df [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides,
or all file systems by default.

du - Shows disk usage of specific files. Use the -d flag for better depth control.

Usage: du [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  or:  du [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
Summarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.

free - Shows current memory(RAM) usage. Use the -h flag for a human readable format.

Usage:
 free [options]

quota - Shows quota information, this is useful for viewing per filesystem limits in places such as a home directory. 

quota: Usage: quota [-guqvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat]
	quota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -u username ...
	quota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -g groupname ...
	quota [-qvswugQm] [-F quotaformat] -f filesystem ...

iostat - Shows drive utilization, as well as other utilizations. Pair this with the watch command for regular updates. 

Usage: iostat [ options ] [ <interval> [ <count> ] ]
Options are:
[ -c ] [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -N ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ] [ -y ] [ -z ]
[ -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } ]
[ [ -T ] -g <group_name> ] [ -p [ <device> [,...] | ALL ] ]
[ <device> [...] | ALL ]

︗Nexus

From UMIACS



Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The Nexus is the combined scheduler of resources in UMIACS.  The resource manager for Nexus is SLURM.  Resources are arranged into partitions where users are able to schedule computational jobs.  Users are arranged into a number of SLURM accounts based on faculty, lab, or center investments.

︗Contents

1 Getting Started

1.1 Access
1.2 Jobs

1.2.1 Interactive
1.2.2 Batch




2 Partitions
3 Quality of Service (QoS)

3.1 Job QoS
3.2 Partition QoS


4 Storage

4.1 Home Directories
4.2 Scratch Directories

4.2.1 Network Scratch Directories
4.2.2 Local Scratch Directories


4.3 Faculty Allocations
4.4 Project Allocations
4.5 Datasets




︗Getting Started
All accounts in UMIACS are sponsored.  If you don't already have a UMIACS account, please see Accounts for information on getting one.  You need a full UMIACS account (not a  collaborator account) in order to access Nexus.

︗Access
Your access to submission nodes (alternatively called login nodes) for Nexus computational resources is determined by your account sponsor's department, center, or lab affiliation.  You can log into the UMIACS Directory CR application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/cr/) and select the Computational Resource (CR) in the list that has the prefix nexus.  The Hosts section lists your available submission nodes - generally a pair of nodes of the format nexus<department, lab, or center abbreviation>[00,01], e.g., nexusgroup00 and nexusgroup01.
Note - UMIACS requires multi-factor authentication through our Duo instance.  This is completely discrete from both UMD's and CSD's Duo instances.  You will need to enroll one or more devices to access resources in UMIACS, and will be prompted to enroll when you log into the Directory application for the first time.
Once you have identified your submission nodes, you can SSH directly into them.  From there, you are able to submit to the cluster via our SLURM workload manager.  You need to make sure that your submitted jobs have the correct account, partition, and qos.

︗Jobs
SLURM jobs are  submitted by either srun or sbatch depending if you are doing an interactive job or batch job, respectively.  You need to provide the where/how/who to run the job and specify the resources you need to run with.
For the who/where/how, you may be required to specify --account, --partition, and/or --qos (respectively) to be able to adequately submit jobs to the Nexus.
For resources, you may need to specify --time for time, --ntasks for CPUs, --mem for RAM, and --gres=gpu for GPUs in your submission arguments to meet your requirements.  There are defaults for all four, so if you don't specify something, you may be scheduled with a very minimal set of time and resources (e.g., by default, NO GPUs are included if you do not specify --gres=gpu).  For more information about submission flags for GPU resources, see  here.  You can also can run man srun on your submission node for a complete list of available submission arguments.
For a list of available GPU types on Nexus and their specs, please see Nexus/GPUs.

︗Interactive
Once logged into a submission node, you can run simple interactive jobs.  If your session is interrupted from the submission node, the job will be killed.  As such, we encourage use of a terminal multiplexer such as Tmux.

$ srun --pty --ntasks=4 --mem=2gb --gres=gpu:1 nvidia-smi -L
GPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-ae5dc1f5-c266-5b9f-58d5-7976e62b3ca1)

︗Batch
Batch jobs are scheduled with a script file with an optional ability to embed job scheduling parameters via variables that are defined by #SBATCH lines at the top of the file.  You can find some examples in our SLURM/JobSubmission documentation.

︗Partitions
The SLURM resource manager uses partitions to act as job queues which can restrict size, time and user limits.  The Nexus has a number of different partitions of resources.  Different Centers, Labs, and Faculty are able to invest in computational resources that are restricted to approved users through these partitions.
Partitions usable by all non-class account users:

Nexus/Tron - Pool of resources available to all UMIACS and CSD faculty and graduate students.
Scavenger - Preemption(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html) partition that supports nodes from multiple other partitions.  More resources are available to schedule simultaneously than in other partitions, however jobs are subject to preemption rules.  You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.  The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again. For an overview of things you can check within scripts to determine if your job was preempted/resumed, see SLURM/Preemption.
Partitions usable by ClassAccounts:

 Class - Pool available for UMIACS class accounts sponsored by either UMIACS or CSD faculty.
Partitions usable by specific lab/center users:

Nexus/CBCB - CBCB lab pool available for CBCB lab members.
Nexus/CLIP - CLIP lab pool available for CLIP lab members.
Nexus/CML - CML lab pool available for CML lab members.
Nexus/GAMMA - GAMMA lab pool available for GAMMA lab members.
Nexus/MBRC - MBRC lab pool available for MBRC lab members.
Nexus/MC2 - MC2 lab pool available for MC2 lab members.
Nexus/Vulcan - Vulcan lab pool available for Vulcan lab members.
︗None
SLURM uses Quality of Service (QoS) both to provide limits on job sizes (termed by us as "job QoS") as well as to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user or per group (termed by us as "partition QoS").

︗Job QoS
Job QoS are used to provide limits on the size of job that you can run. You should try to allocate only the resources your job actually needs, as resources that each of your jobs schedules are counted against your  fair-share priority in the future.

default - Default job QoS. Limited to 4 CPU cores, 1 GPU, and 32GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 3 days.
medium - Limited to 8 CPU cores, 2 GPUs, and 64GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 2 days.
high - Limited to 16 CPU cores, 4 GPUs, and 128GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 1 day.
scavenger - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is both only available in the scavenger partition and the only job QoS available in the scavenger partition. To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.  Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.
You can display these job QoS from the command line using the show_qos command.  By default, the command will only show job QoS that you can access.  The above four job QoS are the ones that everyone can access.

$ show_qos

To find out what accounts and partitions you have access to, first use the show_assoc command to show your account/job QoS combinations. Then, use the scontrol show partition command and note the AllowAccounts entry for each listed partition. You are able to submit to any partition that allows an account that you have. If you need to use an account other than the default account nexus, you will need to specify it via the --account submission argument.

︗Partition QoS
Partition QoS are used to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user (MaxTRESPU) or per group (GrpTRES).
To view partition QoS, use the show_partition_qos command.

$ show_partition_qos
                Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES 
-------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ -------------------- 
           scavenger         500  cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G

If you want to see all partition QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_partition_qos --all command. 

$ show_partition_qos --all
                Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES

NOTE: These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS (i.e., they are not in the AllowQos field for their respective partition). Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.
For example, in the default non-preemption partition (tron), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition.
Lab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two "TRES" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition.
All partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill(The prior text links to https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html#backfill) issues with the SLURM scheduler.

If you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an "outer submission script" that repeatedly attempts to run an "inner submission script" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval.
An example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an  array job, and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less.
#!/bin/bash
numjobs=1000
i=0
while [ $i -lt $numjobs ]
do
  while [[ "$(sbatch example_inner.sh 2>&1)" =~ "QOSMaxSubmitJobPerUserLimit" ]]
  do
    echo "Currently at maximum job submissions allowed."
    echo "Waiting for 5 minutes before trying to submit more jobs."
    sleep 300
  done
  i=$(( $i + 1 ))
  echo "Submitted job $i of $numjobs"
done

It is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.

︗Storage
All network storage available in Nexus is currently NFS based, and comes in a few different flavors. Compute nodes also have local storage that can be used.

︗Home Directories
You have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.
Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.
NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.

︗Scratch Directories
Scratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Nexus compute infrastructure:

Network scratch directories
Local scratch directories
Please note that  class accounts do not have network scratch directories.

︗Network Scratch Directories
You are allocated 200GB of scratch space via NFS from /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME> where <USERNAME> is your UMIACS username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is  automounted; you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access it.
You can view your quota usage by running df -h /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>.
You may request a permanent increase of up to 400GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 400GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a  project allocation for this. If you choose to increase your scratch space beyond 400GB, the increased space is also subject to the 270 TB days limit mentioned in the project allocation section before we check back in for renewal. For example, if you request 1.4TB total space, you may have this for 270 days (1TB beyond the 400GB permanent increase). The amount increased beyond 400GB will also count against your faculty member's 20TB total storage limit mentioned below.
This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.

︗Local Scratch Directories
Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on also has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc. and are not backed up or protected in any way.  These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job as they are mounted from disks directly attached to the compute node.  However, you must stage your data within the confines of your job and extract the relevant resultant data elsewhere before the end of your job.
These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our  monthly maintenance windows.  Please make sure you secure any resultant data you wish to keep from these directories at the end of your job.

︗Faculty Allocations
Each faculty member can be allocated 1TB of permanent lab space upon request.  We can also support grouping these individual allocations together into larger center, lab, or research group allocations if desired by the faculty.  Please  contact staff to inquire.
Lab space storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.

︗Project Allocations
Project allocations are available per user for 270 TB days; you can have a 1TB allocation for up to 270 days, a 3TB allocation for 90 days, etc..
A single faculty member can not have more than 20TB of project allocations across all of their sponsored accounts active simultaneously. Network scratch allocation space increases beyond the 400GB permanent maximum also have the increase count against this limit (i.e., a 1TB network scratch allocation would have 600GB counted towards this limit).
Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.
The maximum allocation length you can request is 540 days (500GB space) and the maximum storage space you can request is 9TB (30 day length).
To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:

Project Name (short)
Description
Size (1TB, 2TB, etc.)
Length in days (270 days, 135 days, etc.)
Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if any
These allocations are available via /fs/nexus-projects/<project name>.  Renewal is not guaranteed to be available due to limits on the amount of total storage.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you are still in need of the storage allocation.  If renewal is available, you can renew for up to another 270 TB days with reapproval from the original faculty approver.

If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.
If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.
If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.
︗Datasets
We have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/nexus-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.
The list of Nexus datasets we currently host can be viewed here(The prior text links to https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Nexus).

︗Introduction
Below are steps outlining how to start a Zoom meeting. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk.

︗Logging into Zoom
Before starting a meeting, be sure to log into your account. Do this by following these steps:

Using the conference room PC, log into the Conference user account. If the PC is already signed into the desktop, first sign out of the desktop and then sign in again to ensure a clean slate. This can happen if someone leaves the Conference Room PC without signing out. It will automatically sign out after 8 hours of inactivity. Please be sure to sign out when you are done.
Using the Display on the Podium, tap the screen to turn it on.
Under the Sources tab at the bottom, select *PC1* or *PC Main*. The image features a control panel for managing audio-visual (A/V) systems, specifically branded with "CRESTRON". The interface is predominantly gray and features various buttons and icons organized in a grid layout. At the top center, a prominent red button labeled "Shutdown A/V System" stands out, flanked by control options for "Device Control". Below this, the panel includes functional icons for "Projector", "PC Main", and "Shared Video", allowing users to manage visual output sources. 

The bottom section prompts users to select a source to route, displaying various options such as "PC 1", "PC 2", "Laptop", "Solstice", and two camera inputs labeled "Camera A" and "Camera B". There are also icons for "Tuner" and "BluRay". The overall design emphasizes clarity and usability, with intuitive iconography suggesting the intended functionality. The interface appears touch-sensitive, intended for use in a professional or educational environment to facilitate seamless A/V setup during presentations or meetings.
You will see the display at the opposite end of the room light up with the Windows login screen. Click the mouse, or press ENTER.
Select the *Conference* account. This does not require a password. Subsequently, any changes you make on the account will not be saved. The image displays a large, flat-screen monitor positioned in a conference room, currently showing the Windows login screen for a user account named "Conference." The background of the screen is predominantly dark, transitioning into hints of blue and gray, creating a professional ambiance. At the center, a circular icon features an outline of a person, indicating a user profile. Directly below this icon, the text "Conference" is prominently displayed, accompanied by the message "* Preparing Windows" indicating the system is initiating preparation for use. The overall visual setting suggests a tech-equipped environment intended for meetings, emphasizing clarity and focus, which is typical in professional settings. The lack of clutter around the display aids concentration, and the soft glow from the screen adds to the room's quiet, business-like atmosphere.
Click the search bar at the bottom left of the Desktop and type in 'Zoom'. You will see the Zoom Application in the search results. Press ENTER, or double click the Zoom Application. The image displays a large flat-screen monitor featuring a close-up of the Windows operating system interface. The screen predominantly showcases the search function of Windows, with the search bar highlighted at the bottom left. The user has entered "zoom," which yields search results. The top section indicates "Best match," with the Zoom application prominently identified, featuring its blue and white logo that resembles a video camera. Below the app title, labeled "Zoom," there are options such as "Open," "Run as administrator," and "Uninstall," along with additional settings related to Magnifier features. The background is a gradient of soft blue tones, characteristic of the Windows 10 interface. The lower taskbar displays common icons, including a folder, a browser, and a notification area, adding to the sense of an active desktop environment. This scene represents a digital workspace, emphasizing the functionality of quickly accessing applications crucial for virtual meetings, particularly highlighting the Zoom video conferencing application that facilitates online communication.
Once you are done, be sure to sign out of the session by right clicking the Windows button in the bottom left of the Desktop, hovering over 'Shut Down or Sign out', and clicking 'sign out'.
Launch the Zoom application. You can either use the shortcut on the desktop or you can search for it in the search bar in the bottom left of the desktop.
On the right side of the login window, click on 'Sign in with SSO', this will allow you to sign in with your UMD credentials. Type in 'umd' under company domain.  Click 'Continue'. This will cause a browser tab to automatically open up.
In the browser, sign in to your UMD account with your credentials. Once you finish signing in on the browser, Zoom should automatically log you into your account. If not, click the big blue 'Launch Zoom' button.
The image displays a Zoom sign-in window, primarily featuring a clean, white background that emphasizes clarity. At the top, the words “Sign In” are prominently displayed. Below this header are two input fields, one labeled “Enter your email” and the other “Enter your password,” both with rectangular outlines. Each field includes placeholder text in a lighter shade, indicating where to input information. 

To the right of the password field is a "Forgot?" link, prompting users to recover login information if necessary. Beneath the input fields are options for staying signed in. 

To the right, there are three social media shortcuts for signing in using Google, Facebook, or the single sign-on (SSO) option. The SSO button is highlighted, making it a focal point as it directs users to a simplified login process. Below, a subtle link invites users to create an account, stating “Sign Up Free.” The overall design is straightforward and intuitive, conducive to a professional setting, underscoring the importance of efficient access in virtual environments. A black arrow points toward the “Sign In with SSO” button, directing attention to this preferred login method.
The image displays a Zoom sign-in interface specifically for users logging in with Single Sign-On (SSO). The background is predominantly white, enhancing clarity and focus. At the top of the image, the header reads “Sign In with SSO” in a bold, dark font, indicating the login method. Below, there is a single input field labeled “Company Domain,” where the text “umd” is already entered. The field features a light blue outline, drawing attention to it. Adjacent to the input field, there's a visible extension indicating the domain format ends with “.zoom.us.” 

A prominent blue button labeled “Continue” is positioned to the right of the input field, inviting the user to proceed after entering their domain. Below this, there’s a link reading “I do not know the company domain,” providing assistance for users who may require further direction. The overall design is user-friendly and intuitive, fitting for a professional setting, and clearly aimed at facilitating a smooth login process for users affiliated with the University of Maryland (UMD).
︗Zoom Meetings
Joining an Existing Meeting

To join an existing meeting, click on 'Join' in the Zoom home page. A popup window will require a meeting ID (usually a 10-11 digit number) or a personal link. This should have been provided to you in advance by the host.
Starting a New Zoom Meeting

To create a new meeting, click on 'New Meeting' in the Zoom home page. Zoom will start the meeting for you.
To invite others to your meeting, follow these steps:
In the Zoom Meeting, click on 'participants' at the bottom. A new window will open up.
At the bottom of the participants window, click the 'invite' button. A new window will open.
At the bottom of this window, click the 'Copy Invitation' button. This will copy a generic invitation message to your clipboard. You may paste this to send to your invitees.
Connecting Zoom Audio

To use the lectern microphone as a source of audio for the zoom, unmute the mic and unmute yourself on Zoom. Alternatively, you may use your personal laptop as an audio source. If you choose to do so, remember to mute the lectern mic to avoid feedback.
Zoom Video Setup

To display video from the conferencing room to the Zoom meeting, select camera A or B, then 'shared video' (red icon in 'Select video source' screen). Adjust the participant layout on Zoom as needed.
To display video from a personal laptop to Zoom, plug in your laptop to any one of the lectern cables. Select 'laptop', then route it to shared video and/or projector or monitor. If your screen is mirrored, deselect 'mirror my background' in video settings on Zoom.
After the Zoom meeting, sign out of the Conference account and shut down the A/V system.

︗Accounts
All  accounts in the Nexus (and UMIACS accounts in general) are required to be sponsored.  New accounts can be requested via our Requests application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/new/).
If you already have a full UMIACS account (not a  collaborator account) then you already have access to Nexus.

︗Faculty
UMIACS and CSD faculty members can use the Requests application(The prior text links to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/new/) to request new accounts for themselves. When filling out the form as a faculty member, please use the username of the current Director of Computing Facilities at UMIACS as the Principal Investigator.  This is currently derek.
Once you submit the initial form, you will be required to verify the email address you have listed as your external contact.  Once verified, the Director of Computing Facilities will approve sponsorship of the account and your account will be installed within 24 business hours (9am-5pm M-F).
After receiving an account, faculty can let their students know to request an account listing them as the Principal Investigator.  Faculty will receive an email to confirm sponsorship through this same application when a student requests an account.  Once approved, these sponsored accounts will be installed within 24 business hours (9am-5pm M-F).

︗None

UMIACS conducts backups to provide accidental deletion coverage. We aim to provide 90 days of coverage, at one backup per night. However, this coverage may not be perfect, as our backups are very coarse. Depending on the size of the change and size of the file, backups may be periodically missed. Furthermore, files that change often may not have all versions backed up to 90 days, and files which were created very recently may not be backed up.
If you need anything from our nightly backups, please contact staff with the full path to the directory(s) which you would like to have restored.

︗Connecting an External Device
There are two ways that you can connect your device to the office TVs: VGA cable or HDMI cable. The only main difference between the two is that HDMI transfers sound natively, while with VGA you will need to connect an additional 3.5mm audio cable. With either approach, the general steps are as follows:



Connect your cable of choice to the device you wish to display on the screen.
You may need an adapter if you are using a laptop.


Connect the other end of the cable to the wall port (usually located opposite of the TV).

If you do not see your device automatically appearing on the TV, you may need to turn on the TV or adjust the input of the TV (both done using the remote). 
If you do not currently have a remote for your TV, you can get one from the UMIACS Help Desk.
To adjust the input of the TV, click the source button on the remote, located between the volume and channel buttons, and select the proper input named HDMI 1.



Once you connect your device, there are different display modes that can be chosen. Some operating systems may have additional nonstandard options which are described on the individual display mode pages listed below. The following is a description of the basic two modes that all operating systems have:

Mirror: Displays the same screen on both your computer and the TV.
Extend: Will use the TV as a second screen which you can access by moving your mouse off your current display.
If you wish to change your display mode, you can click on the appropriate link below to see a detailed how-to complete with pictures for your particular operating system:

 Windows Change Display Mode
 macOS Change Display Mode
 RHEL Change Display Mode


︗Displaying Still Images and Playing a Slide Show
There is a USB port on the back of the TV that can be used to display still images or play a slideshow. To be able to follow this guide, you must have a remote which you can pick up from the UMIACS Help Desk if you do not already have one. Now that you have a remote, follow these steps:



Upload all of the pictures that you want the TV to display onto a flash drive and plug the flash drive into the USB port on the TV (located around the right edge).


Click the source button on the remote and navigate to the MagicInfo S option if it is not already there.


You should now see Player in the top left of your screen. If you do not, either click on the player option if you see one in the menu or click the return button on your remote. Now you should see Player in the upper left of your screen.


Directly below the word Player, there is a dropdown menu that says Internal Memory. Navigate to it and change it to the name of your USB using the remotes navigation buttons.


You can now navigate to and click on a picture to make it display fullscreen.
You may notice that it automatically starts playing a slideshow if you have more than one picture in the same directory. You can click the play and pause buttons on the remote to toggle this behavior.


To change the slideshow speed, orientation, and transition effects, click the options dropdown in the top right of the file explorer. There you can see the many options available to be changed.



The TVs have ~4.5 GB of space available for you to upload files to from your USB. To do this, follow these steps:



Navigate to the options menu in the top right and select the Send option.


Select all of the images you want to be stored onto the TV.


When you are done selecting, click the Send button located in the top right and click Internal Memory from the dropdown. When a popup box appears, click Start.


Once the process completes, you can navigate back to the internal memory through the dropdown in the top left and you will see all of the pictures you selected are now there.


You can now remove the USB and play the images off of your TV.

DETAILS:
Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
Offering: GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated
Git is a distributed version control system, which means you can work locally,
then share or push your changes to a server. In this case, the server you push to is GitLab.
GitLab uses the SSH protocol to securely communicate with Git.
When you use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server,
you don't need to supply your username and password each time.
︗None
SSH uses two keys, a public key and a private key.

The public key can be distributed.
The private key should be protected.

It is not possible to reveal confidential data by uploading your public key. When you need to copy or upload your SSH public key, make sure you do not accidentally copy or upload your private key instead.
You can use your private key to sign commits(The prior text links to project/repository/signed_commits/ssh.md),
which makes your use of GitLab and your data even more secure.
This signature then can be verified by anyone using your public key.
For details, see Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography(The prior text links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).
︗None
To use SSH to communicate with GitLab, you need:

The OpenSSH client, which comes pre-installed on GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows 10.
SSH version 6.5 or later. Earlier versions used an MD5 signature, which is not secure.

To view the version of SSH installed on your system, run ssh -V.
︗None
To communicate with GitLab, you can use the following SSH key types:

ED25519
ED25519_SK
ECDSA_SK
RSA
ECDSA (As noted in Practical Cryptography With Go(The prior text links to https://leanpub.com/gocrypto/read#leanpub-auto-ecdsa), the security issues related to DSA also apply to ECDSA.)

Administrators can restrict which keys are permitted and their minimum lengths(The prior text links to ../security/ssh_keys_restrictions.md).
︗None
The book Practical Cryptography With Go(The prior text links to https://leanpub.com/gocrypto/read#leanpub-auto-chapter-5-digital-signatures)
suggests that ED25519(The prior text links to https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) keys are more secure and performant than RSA keys.
OpenSSH 6.5 introduced ED25519 SSH keys in 2014, and they should be available on most
operating systems.
︗None
To use ED25519_SK SSH keys on GitLab, your local client and GitLab server
must have OpenSSH 8.2(The prior text links to https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#8.2) or later installed.
︗None
To use ECDSA_SK SSH keys on GitLab, your local client and GitLab server
must have OpenSSH 8.2(The prior text links to https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#8.2) or later installed.
︗None


Maximum RSA key length changed(The prior text links to https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11186) in GitLab 16.3.


Available documentation suggests ED25519 is more secure than RSA.
If you use an RSA key, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Publication 800-57 Part 3 (PDF)(The prior text links to https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57Pt3r1.pdf)
recommends a key size of at least 2048 bits. Due to limitations in Go,
RSA keys cannot exceed 8192 bits(The prior text links to ssh_troubleshooting.md#tls-server-sent-certificate-containing-rsa-key-larger-than-8192-bits).
The default key size depends on your version of ssh-keygen.
Review the man page for your installed ssh-keygen command for details.
︗None
Before you create a key pair, see if a key pair already exists.


Go to your home directory.


Go to the .ssh/ subdirectory. If the .ssh/ subdirectory doesn't exist,
you are either not in the home directory, or you haven't used ssh before.
In the latter case, you need to generate an SSH key pair.


See if a file with one of the following formats exists:



Algorithm
Public key
Private key




ED25519 (preferred)
id_ed25519.pub
id_ed25519


ED25519_SK
id_ed25519_sk.pub
id_ed25519_sk


ECDSA_SK
id_ecdsa_sk.pub
id_ecdsa_sk


RSA (at least 2048-bit key size)
id_rsa.pub
id_rsa


DSA (deprecated)
id_dsa.pub
id_dsa


ECDSA
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ecdsa





︗None
If you do not have an existing SSH key pair, generate a new one:


Open a terminal.


Run ssh-keygen -t followed by the key type and an optional comment.
This comment is included in the .pub file that's created.
You may want to use an email address for the comment.
For example, for ED25519:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<comment>"


For 2048-bit RSA:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "<comment>"




Press Enter. Output similar to the following is displayed:

Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):




Accept the suggested filename and directory, unless you are generating a deploy key(The prior text links to project/deploy_keys/index.md)
or want to save in a specific directory where you store other keys.
You can also dedicate the SSH key pair to a specific host.


Specify a passphrase(The prior text links to https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase):

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:


A confirmation is displayed, including information about where your files are stored.


A public and private key are generated. Add the public SSH key to your GitLab account
and keep the private key secure.
︗None
If you did not save your SSH key pair in the default directory,
configure your SSH client to point to the directory where the private key is stored.


Open a terminal and run this command:

eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add <directory to private SSH key>




Save these settings in the ~/.ssh/config file. For example:

# GitLab.com
Host gitlab.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab_com_rsa

# Private GitLab instance
Host gitlab.company.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example_com_rsa




For more information on these settings, see the man ssh_config(The prior text links to https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config) page in the SSH configuration manual.
Public SSH keys must be unique to GitLab because they bind to your account.
Your SSH key is the only identifier you have when you push code with SSH.
It must uniquely map to a single user.
︗None
You can update the passphrase for your SSH key:


Open a terminal and run this command:

ssh-keygen -p -f /path/to/ssh_key




At the prompts, enter the passphrase and then press Enter.


︗None
If your version of OpenSSH is between 6.5 and 7.8, you can save your private
RSA SSH keys in a more secure OpenSSH format by opening a terminal and running
this command:

ssh-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa


Alternatively, you can generate a new RSA key with the more secure encryption format with
the following command:

ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<comment>"


︗None
To generate ED25519_SK or ECDSA_SK SSH keys, you must use OpenSSH 8.2 or later:


Insert a hardware security key into your computer.


Open a terminal.


Run ssh-keygen -t followed by the key type and an optional comment.
This comment is included in the .pub file that's created.
You may want to use an email address for the comment.
For example, for ED25519_SK:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -C "<comment>"


For ECDSA_SK:

ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -C "<comment>"


If your security key supports FIDO2 resident keys, you can enable this when
creating your SSH key:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -C "<comment>"


-O resident indicates that the key should be stored on the FIDO authenticator itself.
Resident key is easier to import to a new computer because it can be loaded directly
from the security key by ssh-add -K(The prior text links to https://man.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/ssh-add.1#K)
or  ssh-keygen -K(The prior text links to https://man.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/ssh-keygen#K).


Press Enter. Output similar to the following is displayed:

Generating public/private ed25519-sk key pair.
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.




Touch the button on the hardware security key.


Accept the suggested filename and directory:

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk):




Specify a passphrase(The prior text links to https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/passphrase):

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:


A confirmation is displayed, including information about where your files are stored.


A public and private key are generated.
Add the public SSH key to your GitLab account.
︗None
︗None
You can use 1Password(The prior text links to https://1password.com/) and the 1Password browser extension(The prior text links to https://support.1password.com/getting-started-browser/) to either:

Automatically generate a new SSH key.
Use an existing SSH key in your 1Password vault to authenticate with GitLab.

In the Title box, enter a description, like Work Laptop or
Home Workstation.
Optional. Select the Usage type of the key. It can be used either for Authentication or Signing or both. Authentication & Signing is the default value.
Optional. Update Expiration date to modify the default expiration date.
Select Add key.

For more information about using 1Password with SSH keys, see the 1Password documentation(The prior text links to https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/get-started/).

To use SSH with GitLab, copy your public key to your GitLab account:


Copy the contents of your public key file. You can do this manually or use a script.
For example, to copy an ED25519 key to the clipboard:
macOS

tr -d '\n' < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy


Linux (requires the xclip package)

xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Git Bash on Windows

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip


Replace id_ed25519.pub with your filename. For example, use id_rsa.pub for RSA.


Sign in to GitLab.


On the left sidebar, select your avatar.


Select Edit profile.


On the left sidebar, select SSH Keys.


Select Add new key.


In the Key box, paste the contents of your public key.
If you manually copied the key, make sure you copy the entire key,
which starts with ssh-rsa, ssh-dss, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
ssh-ed25519, sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com, or sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com, and may end with a comment.


In the Title box, type a description, like Work Laptop or
Home Workstation.


Optional. Select the Usage type of the key. It can be used either for Authentication or Signing or both. Authentication & Signing is the default value.


Optional. Update Expiration date to modify the default expiration date.

Administrators can view expiration dates and use them for
guidance when deleting keys(The prior text links to ../administration/credentials_inventory.md#delete-a-users-ssh-key).
GitLab checks all SSH keys at 01:00 AM UTC every day. It emails an expiration notice for all SSH keys that are scheduled to expire seven days from now.
GitLab checks all SSH keys at 02:00 AM UTC every day. It emails an expiration notice for all SSH keys that expire on the current date.



Select Add key.


︗None
Verify that your SSH key was added correctly.
The following commands use the example hostname gitlab.example.com. Replace this example hostname with your GitLab instance's hostname, for example, git@gitlab.com.
By default, GitLab uses git username to authenticate. It can be different if it was changed by the administrator(The prior text links to https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#change-the-name-of-the-git-user-or-group).


To ensure you're connecting to the correct server, check the server's SSH host keys fingerprint. For:

GitLab.com, see the SSH host keys fingerprints(The prior text links to gitlab_com/index.md#ssh-host-keys-fingerprints) documentation.
GitLab.com or another GitLab instance, see gitlab.example.com/help/instance_configuration#ssh-host-keys-fingerprints where gitlab.example.com is gitlab.com (for
GitLab.com) or the address of the GitLab instance.



Open a terminal and run this command, replacing gitlab.example.com with your
GitLab instance URL:

ssh -T git@gitlab.example.com




If this is the first time you connect, you should verify the
authenticity of the GitLab host. If you see a message like:

The authenticity of host 'gitlab.example.com (35.231.145.151)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:HbW3g8zUjNSksFbqTiUWPWg2Bq1x8xdGUrliXFzSnUw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'gitlab.example.com' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.


Type yes and press Enter.


Run the ssh -T git@gitlab.example.com command again. You should receive a Welcome to GitLab, @username! message.


If the welcome message doesn't appear, you can troubleshoot by running ssh
in verbose mode:

ssh -Tvvv git@gitlab.example.com


︗None
You can use a different key for each repository.
Open a terminal and run this command:

git config core.sshCommand "ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i ~/.ssh/private-key-filename-for-this-repository -F /dev/null"


This command does not use the SSH Agent and requires Git 2.10 or later. For more information
on ssh command options, see the man pages for both ssh and ssh_config.
︗None
To view the SSH keys for your account:

On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
Select Edit profile.
On the left sidebar, select SSH Keys.

Your existing SSH keys are listed at the bottom of the page. The information includes:

The key's:

Name.
Public fingerprint.
Expiry date.
Permitted usage types.


The time a key was last used.

︗None
To permanently delete an SSH key:

On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
Select Edit profile.
On the left sidebar, select SSH Keys.
Next to the key you want to delete, select Remove ({remove}).
Select Delete.

︗None
You can use multiple accounts to connect to a single instance of GitLab. You
can do this by using the command in the previous topic.
However, even if you set IdentitiesOnly to yes, you cannot sign in if an
IdentityFile exists outside of a Host block.
Instead, you can assign aliases to hosts in the ~/.ssh/config file.

For the Host, use an alias like user_1.gitlab.com and
user_2.gitlab.com. Advanced configurations
are more difficult to maintain, and these strings are easier to
understand when you use tools like git remote.
For the IdentityFile, use the path the private key.


# User1 Account Identity
Host <user_1.gitlab.com>
  Hostname gitlab.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<example_ssh_key1>

# User2 Account Identity
Host <user_2.gitlab.com>
  Hostname gitlab.com
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<example_ssh_key2>


Now, to clone a repository for user_1, use user_1.gitlab.com in the git clone command:

git clone git@<user_1.gitlab.com>:gitlab-org/gitlab.git


To update a previously-cloned repository that is aliased as origin:

git remote set-url origin git@<user_1.gitlab.com>:gitlab-org/gitlab.git


NOTE:
Private and public keys contain sensitive data. Ensure the permissions
on the files make them readable to you but not accessible to others.
︗None
You can set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for
Git over SSH(The prior text links to ../security/two_factor_authentication.md#2fa-for-git-over-ssh-operations). We recommend using
ED25519_SK or ECDSA_SK SSH keys.
︗None
If you are using EGit(The prior text links to https://eclipse.dev/egit/), you can add your SSH key to Eclipse(The prior text links to https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Eclipse_SSH_Configuration).
︗None
If you're running Windows 10, you can either use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
with WSL 2(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#update-to-wsl-2) which
has both git and ssh preinstalled, or install Git for Windows(The prior text links to https://gitforwindows.org) to
use SSH through PowerShell.
The SSH key generated in WSL is not directly available for Git for Windows, and vice versa,
as both have a different home directory:

WSL: /home/<user>

Git for Windows: C:\Users\<user>


You can either copy over the .ssh/ directory to use the same key, or generate a key in each environment.
If you're running Windows 11 and using OpenSSH for Windows(The prior text links to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview), ensure the HOME
environment variable is set correctly. Otherwise, your private SSH key might not be found.
Alternative tools include:

Cygwin(The prior text links to https://www.cygwin.com)

PuTTYgen(The prior text links to https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) 0.81 and later (earlier versions are vulnerable to disclosure attacks(The prior text links to https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6))

︗None
GitLab integrates with the system-installed SSH daemon and designates a user
(typically named git) through which all access requests are handled. Users
who connect to the GitLab server over SSH are identified by their SSH key instead
of their username.
SSH client operations performed on the GitLab server are executed as this
user. You can modify this SSH configuration. For example, you can specify
a private SSH key for this user to use for authentication requests. However, this practice
is not supported and is strongly discouraged as it presents significant
security risks.
GitLab checks for this condition, and directs you
to this section if your server is configured this way. For example:

$ gitlab-rake gitlab:check

Git user has default SSH configuration? ... no
  Try fixing it:
  mkdir ~/gitlab-check-backup-1504540051
  sudo mv /var/lib/git/.ssh/id_rsa ~/gitlab-check-backup-1504540051
  sudo mv /var/lib/git/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/gitlab-check-backup-1504540051
  For more information see:
  doc/user/ssh.md#overriding-ssh-settings-on-the-gitlab-server
  Please fix the error above and rerun the checks.


Remove the custom configuration as soon as you can. These customizations
are explicitly not supported and may stop working at any time.
︗None
The GitLab SSH folder and files must have the following permissions:

The folder /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/ must be owned by the git group and the git user, with permissions set to 700.
The authorized_keys file must have permissions set to 600.
The authorized_keys.lock file must have permissions set to 644.

To verify that these permissions are correct, run the following:

stat -c "%a %n" /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/.


︗None
If the permissions are wrong, sign in to the application server and run:

cd /var/opt/gitlab/
chown git:git /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/
chmod 700  /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/
chmod 600  /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 644  /var/opt/gitlab/.ssh/authorized_keys.lock

︗About Us







The University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, known by its acronym UMIACS (pronounced YOU-me-acks), is a multidisciplinary computing research institute led by distinguished researchers and supported by a cutting-edge infrastructure. UMIACS pioneers computational science involving national defense, precision medicine, big data, cybersecurity, language and culture, and more. 
Established in 1984, the institute's primary mission is to use a team-based approach—supported by powerful computing resources—to address grand challenges in science and society. Much of our research (currently exceeding $25 million annually in external awards) is funded by the numerous federal agencies and labs that dot the region. We also regularly partner with physicians and clinicians at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.
The institute is involved in educational activities in a myriad of ways. We currently support more than 200 graduate students (most at the Ph.D. level) from multiple disciplines—computer science, engineering, linguistics, physics, information science, human-computer interaction, geographical sciences, and more—in our centers and labs. Our faculty regularly mentor visiting undergraduates through NSF-funded summer internship research programs. And the institute provides substantial administrative and technical support for undergraduate interdisciplinary educational programs such as the Immersive Media Design (IMD) program.(The prior text links to https://imd.umd.edu/) 
In 2019, most of our faculty, staff and graduate students moved into the Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering,(The prior text links to https://iribe.umd.edu/) a stunning 215,00 square foot facility that encourages innovation and collaboration. We also maintain a powerful data center and auxiliary office space in the nearby A.V. Williams Building (our former home). Faculty and students active in quantum information science have modern, renovated offices and meeting rooms in the Atlantic Building.
The success of UMIACS in catalyzing and excelling in interdisciplinary applications of computing is often attributed to: (1) identification and focus on grand challenge applications of computing with significant societal impact, (2) identifying and incentivizing outstanding faculty to excel in their research through rotating appointments, and (3) mediating interaction amongst interdisciplinary researchers through an outstanding computational infrastructure. We have developed the skill set and culture necessary for building strong interdisciplinary research programs, providing advanced computing research infrastructure, and first-rate technical support, which have greatly facilitated our national and international leadership role in multi-disciplinary computing.
The synergistic environment provided by UMIACS is currently enabling innovative collaborations between faculty from computer science(The prior text links to http://www.cs.umd.edu), electrical and computer engineering(The prior text links to http://www.ece.umd.edu/), linguistics(The prior text links to http://ling.umd.edu), biology(The prior text links to http://biology.umd.edu), geographical sciences(The prior text links to https://geog.umd.edu), cell biology and molecular genetics(The prior text links to http://www.cbmg.umd.edu/), the Robert H. Smith School of Business(The prior text links to http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/) and the College of Information Studies(The prior text links to http://ischool.umd.edu) (iSchool).
We also have affiliate or adjunct faculty from physics(The prior text links to https://umdphysics.umd.edu), chemistry and biochemistry(The prior text links to http://www.chem.umd.edu), philosophy(The prior text links to https://philosophy.umd.edu) and mechanical engineering(The prior text links to https://enme.umd.edu), as well as nine federal scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology(The prior text links to https://www.nist.gov) that are embedded full-time on the UMD campus working in our quantum information science groups.
︗Who is UMIACS?
UMIACS is comprised of many talented individuals that fall largely into one of the categories listed below. Except for graduate students and affiliate or adjunct members, an individual is a member of UMIACS if they have a payroll appointment in the institute, i.e., if at least part of their salary is paid through the institute.
︗Staff
Business office, technology, and communication staff provide the core services offered to our community. 
︗Students
 UMIACS faculty serve as mentors to many graduate students. These students are initially admitted to the campus through one of the graduate programs to which our faculty belong, then join the institute when they join the labs of our faculty. Students with a payroll appointment in UMIACS are paid at UMIACS graduate stipend rates. 
︗Professional track faculty
 Professional track (PTK) faculty is a University of Maryland term/category for faculty who are not eligible for tenure. In UMIACS, such faculty are mostly engaged in research activities, are appointed on a contractual basis, and largely supported through external funding. Professional track faculty appointments are governed by the UMIACS Appointment, Evaluation, and Promotion (APT) policy for professional track faculty. 
︗Postdoctoral researchers
 According to the University of Maryland policies, postdoctoral researchers are classified as professional track faculty (see above). Unlike other professional track titles, postdoctoral appointments are temporary. An individual may hold this title for a maximum of 6 years, and new hires must have completed their Ph.D. within five years of the start of their appointment.
︗Core/joint tenure track faculty
 Tenured or tenure-track faculty members who have a payroll appointment in the institute represent the core faculty of the institute and are responsible for staffing the committees that govern our operations, and for leading the scientific activities of the institute. UMIACS is not a tenure-granting unit, thus all core tenure-track faculty have joint appointments in other departments on campus. All joint appointments in the institute are made on a rotating basis and are reviewed by the UMIACS Appointments, Promotion, and Tenure (APT) committee. Appointments at the assistant and associate professor levels are typically renewed every 3 years, while appointments at the full professor level are typically renewed every 5 years.
︗Affiliate and adjunct faculty
 Faculty from outside the University of Maryland (adjunct) as well as campus faculty with no-cost appointments in the institute (affiliate) may have an affiliation with the institute to create stronger ties with our faculty. Generally, such affiliations do not make any UMIACS resources available to these affiliate and adjunct faculty other than including them in institute-wide communications.  Resources may be provided to affiliate and adjunct faculty only in the context of externally funded research projects that are led by UMIACS faculty and that are routed through the UMIACS business office.
︗What services does UMIACS provide?
Basic technical services that are available to all UMIACS faculty, postdocs, staff, and students:
UMIACS Help Desk support for faculty and their affiliated postdocs, staff, students, and external collaborators who have UMIACS accounts
UMIACS-hosted collaboration technologies such as GitLab and Wikis
Printing services
Physical and virtual network connectivity
Advanced technical services
The following are provided to UMIACS faculty and, depending on scope, may require additional financial resources to be identified:
Assistance in grant preparation: design of computational system, budget preparation, etc.
Assistance in purchasing of computational/technological equipment: negotiation with vendors, purchasing, etc.
1TB storage in an object store (similar to AWS S3) for staging and sharing of data
Data backup services
Modern data center facilities
︗Business office services
Pre-and post-award management of complex grants: including budgeting, proposal preparation, financial management, compliance, and reporting, etc.
Personnel management: appointments, benefits, visas, travel, etc.
Purchasing
Conference management: managing registrations, space scheduling, catering, etc.
︗Communications services
Developing well-written stories about research achievements and other newsworthy items and sharing them with college and campus communication groups
Pitching news items to local, national and international media and coordinating media interviews
Dissemination of news/research achievements through social media
Additional communication services that go beyond what can be supported by the Institute are also offered under a cost-recovery model:
Development of visual media such as photo shoots and video production
Creation of high-quality brochures or other printed materials
Assistance with the development of content for websites (note: only limited support provided contingent on the availability of communications personnel)
︗How can I join UMIACS?
If you are a prospective tenure track faculty member, express your interest to join UMIACS to the chair of the search committee and/or the chair of the department in which you are being hired. Ideally you should also seek to meet the director of UMIACS during your campus visit to assess whether an appointment in UMIACS will be mutually beneficial to you and the institute.
If you are a prospective professional track faculty member (including postdocs), look for job openings at https://ejobs.umd.edu.(The prior text links to https://ejobs.umd.edu) On occasion, jobs specific to UMIACS are cross posted on the UMIACS employment page.(The prior text links to https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/careers)
If you are a graduate student, look for faculty in your graduate program who are members of UMIACS. An updated list of UMIACS faculty is available here.(The prior text links to https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/people/faculty)
If you are a tenure track faculty member looking for a “core” joint appointment in UMIACS, meet with the UMIACS director to assess whether an appointment in UMIACS will be mutually beneficial to you and the institute. If you desire to proceed, you will also have to receive the approval of the chair of your tenure home department, and the chair, together with the UMIACS director, will have to agree on the financial terms of your appointment. Finally, the appointment will have to be approved by the UMIACS APT committee. New appointments typically start on July 1st, aligned with the fiscal year.
If you are a faculty member looking for an affiliate (on campus) or adjunct (off-campus) appointment in UMIACS, meet with the UMIACS director to assess whether an appointment in UMIACS will be mutually beneficial to you and the institute. If you desire to proceed, the appointment will also have to be approved by the UMIACS APT committee. New appointments typically start on July 1st, aligned with the fiscal year.

            PRIMARY PRINCIPLES: FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
          

Freedom of expression and an open environment to pursue scholarly inquiry and for sharing of information are encouraged, supported, and protected at the University of Maryland. These values lie at the core of our academic community. Censorship is not compatible with the tradition and goals of the University. While some computing resources are dedicated to specific research, teaching, or administrative tasks that would limit their use, freedom of expression must, in general, be protected. The University does not limit access to information because of its content when it meets the standard of legality. The University's policy of freedom of expression applies to computing resources. Concomitant with free expression are personal obligations of each member of our community to use computing resources responsibly, ethically, and in a manner which accords both with the law and the rights of others. The University depends first upon a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation to create and maintain an open community of responsible users.

︗
            GENERAL
          

This policy sets forth standards for responsible and acceptable use of University information technology (IT) resources. These resources include computer systems, computer labs, applications, networks, software, and files. IT resources are provided to support the academic, research, instructional, and administrative objectives of the University. These resources are extended for the sole use of University faculty, staff, students, and all other authorized guests to accomplish tasks related to the status of that individual at the University, and consistent with the University’s mission.Those using University IT resources, whether at the University or elsewhere, are responsible for complying with security standards set forth by the Vice President and Chief Information Officer (VP/CIO), safeguarding identification codes and passwords, and for using them solely for their intended purposes. Individuals are solely responsible for their personal use of IT resources and are prohibited from representing or implying that statements related to such use constitute the views or policies of the University. The maintenance, operation, and security of IT resources require responsible University personnel to monitor and access systems and networks. To the extent possible in the electronic environment and in a public setting, a user’s privacy will be preserved. Nevertheless, that privacy is subject to applicable federal and state law, including the Maryland Public Information Act, and the needs of the University to meet its administrative, business, and legal obligations.

︗
            PROHIBITED CONDUCT
          

The following provisions describe conduct prohibited under this policy:Altering system software or hardware configurations without authorization; disrupting or interfering with the delivery or administration of IT resources.Attempting to access or accessing another's accounts, private files, e-mail messages, or intercepting network communication without the owner's permission except as appropriate to your job duties and in accordance with legitimate University purposes.Misrepresenting oneself as another individual in electronic communication.Installing, copying, distributing, or using digital content (including software, music, text, images, and video) in violation of copyright and/or software agreements or applicable federal and state law.Engaging in conduct that interferes with others’ use of shared IT resources.Using University IT resources for commercial or profitmaking purposes or to represent the interests of groups unaffiliated with the University or unassociated with the normal professional activities of faculty, staff or students without written authorization from the University.Ignoring individual departmental or unit lab and system policies, procedures, and protocols.Facilitating access to University IT resources by unauthorized users.Exposing sensitive or confidential information or disclosing any electronic information that one does not have the authority to disclose.Knowingly using IT resources for illegal activities. Criminal or illegal use may include obscenity, child pornography, threats, harassment, copyright infringement, University trademark infringement, defamation, theft, identity theft, and unauthorized access.

︗
            ENFORCEMENT
          

Violation of the provisions of this policy constitutes unacceptable use of IT resources, and may violate other University policies and/or state and federal law. Known or suspected violations should be reported to the appropriate University computing unit. Reports may also be sent to the security unit within the Office of Information Technology (abuse@umd.edu). If possible, reports should include a copy of any non-sensitive information relevant to the putative violation.Violations will be acted upon by the appropriate University authorities and/or law enforcement agencies. Violations may result in the restriction or revocation of access to IT resources; faculty, staff, or student disciplinary action; academic dishonesty proceedings through the Student Honor Council; or legal action.The VP/CIO or designee may suspend, block, relocate to a secure location, or restrict access to information and network resources when necessary to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of University IT resources or to protect the University from liability. Notice of such action will be provided to the designated security contact for the affected unit.

︗
            ADMINISTRATION
          

Individual areas within the University (including divisions, colleges, schools, and departments) may elaborate upon this policy with unit-specific policies as long as they do not violate the spirit and intent expressed elsewhere in this policy.Consistent with University System of Maryland requirements, this policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed based on the recommendations of the VP/CIO.

4.1 Unlocking the drive with the YubiKey
4.2 Unlocking the drive with the recovery password


5 Extra configuration

5.1 Set up Auto-unlock
5.2 Use an encrypted drive as a backup drive




︗Overview
BitLocker can be used on fixed hard drives (i.e. internal to your computer) as well as on portable hard drives (i.e. USB). If you want to hold a secure, offline copy of files that you want to be preserved, BitLocker To Go(The prior text links to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-to-go-faq) with a portable hard drive with data to be stored and a hardware token as the key can be used together to do so.

︗Prerequisites
A portable hard drive formatted with an NTFS (preferred), FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT file system.
Any desktop edition of Windows 10/11 except Home. BitLocker encryption is not included as a feature of Windows 10/11 Home, though encrypted drives can still be accessed via Windows 10/11 Home.
A YubiKey security token(The prior text links to https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc). Other security tokens may work, but this procedure will focus on using a YubiKey.
(optional) One or more (2+ strongly preferred) blank USB flash drives at least 500MB in size, formatted with any Windows-writable file system.
︗Initializing the YubiKey and hard drive
Log in locally to the machine you wish to use for encryption. This procedure will not work over Remote Desktop.
Download and install the YubiKey personalization tool(The prior text links to https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-personalization-tools/). Choose the first option (not the command line interface version). If you are using a UMIACS-supported workstation, please contact  UMIACS Staff to install this on your machine.
Insert your YubiKey into any USB slot on the machine you wish to use for encryption and launch the personalization tool. Select Static Password at the top and then Advanced.
The image showcases the YubiKey Personalization Tool interface, specifically in the "Static Password" mode.

︗Extra configuration
︗Set up Auto-unlock
BitLocker has the ability to auto-unlock an encrypted drive for a specific user(s) when plugged into a specific computer(s) if so desired. This creates an entry in the Windows registry on each computer's local data storage for each user you turn it on for. The entry stores a copy of the volume master key for the encrypted drive that is itself encrypted with a combination of the user's username and either the user's password, if there is one, or computer credentials.
We do not recommend turning this on as it undermines the concept of separation of the unlock methods for the drive from any specific computer. If you do want to turn this on, please ensure the user account(s) that you turn it on for are secure (i.e. have sufficiently complex passwords) and the computer(s) that you turn it on for are in secure locations.
To enable auto-unlock for a drive (per user per computer):

Insert your already-encrypted portable hard drive into any USB slot, unlock it, and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.
The image shows the Windows 10 start menu interface, where the search function is actively searching for "bitlocker." At the top left of the screen, the search bar is filled with the term "bitlocker," and the search results are displayed below. The primary result, "Manage BitLocker," is highlighted in blue, indicating it’s the best match for the search. This entry is accompanied by an icon featuring a padlock and a key over a disk, symbolizing security. On the right side, the control panel description denotes that selecting this option leads to the BitLocker management interface, allowing users to manage encryption settings for their drives. The clean layout, with a light grey background, presents an organized view, illustrating a user-friendly environment that emphasizes accessibility and efficiency in accessing system utilities. Overall, the design focuses on guiding users through the process of managing BitLocker encryption on their Windows devices.

Below, sections categorize different drives: the operating system drive, fixed data drives, and the removable data drives section titled "Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go."

The lower part of the screen highlights a portable hard drive labeled (F:), which is currently secured with BitLocker encryption. The detail "Turn on auto-unlock" appears prominently in a red box, signaling a crucial user action to enhance convenience. Options such as “Back up your recovery key,” “Change password,” and “Remove password” are also listed under the drive's label, directing users toward additional BitLocker management features. 

The layout is organized and user-friendly, with a light background enhancing readability. Clear labeling of each function allows users to navigate the BitLocker settings easily, thus ensuring a smooth administrative experience regarding drive security.
The drive will now auto-unlock when plugged into the computer you are currently on for your user account only. You can turn it off again by clicking on the Turn off auto-unlock option that appears in the same location after clicking the turn on button.
︗Use an encrypted drive as a backup drive
One of the more useful things you may want to do with a BitLocker-encrypted portable hard drive is set up automatic backup to it. This can be done by following the procedure on  this page, though please note you will need to unlock the drive each time when plugging it into a computer, or have configured auto-unlock for that computer, before it is accessible by backup software.

Compliance with this Standard is necessary for the University to meet all the requirements of the USM IT Security Standards(The prior text links to http://www.usmd.edu/usm/adminfinance/itcc/USMITSecurityStandards.pdf) and the UMD Policy on Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources(The prior text links to https://www.president.umd.edu/administration/policies/section-x-miscellaneous-policies/x-100a).Top(The prior text links to https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport#top)︗DefinitionsTerms used in this article and their definitions.TermDefinitionUniversity BusinessThe work performed on behalf of the University by its personnel (including faculty, staff, student employees, and other persons whose conduct falls under University operations), whether or not such persons receive compensation for performing this work.Institutional EmailThe UMD email system/platform provided and maintained by the Division of Information Technology (username@umd.edu) enabled by Google Workspace for Education, also known as UMD Gmail or UMD Email.Approved Email SystemUMD Institutional Email (aka UMD Gmail), plus any administrative, academic, or programmatic unit's email system granted a waiver by the Division of IT.Top(The prior text links to https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport#top)︗RequirementsThe University requires its personnel to use an Approved Email System to conduct University Business.

Email must not be used to transmit data with a risk level of High (Level 3) or Restricted (Level 4) as defined by the IT-2 University of Maryland Data Classification Standard(The prior text links to https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0012438).As State of Maryland employees, UMD personnel should not use an Approved Email System for private gains or personal matters, or matters that create or appear to create either a conflict of interest or an endorsement by the University. While incidental personal use of UMD Email is acceptable, employees are strongly encouraged to use a separate, non-UMD email system for personal matters.There are significant differences in the agreement language and the data collected between a typical consumer Gmail account and UMD's Gmail (G Suite for Education) accounts. Therefore, automatically forwarding emails and documents from an Approved Email System to another email account/platform (e.g., @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, etc.) is prohibited. This practice greatly elevates the risks of sharing information that is protected as confidential by federal and/or state law or the University's contractual obligations. If University personnel are required by the terms of a University contract or other legal agreement to use a United States federal agency email account, the University may permit University email to be forwarded to a federal agency email account or otherwise defer to any federal agency requirements incorporated into the University's applicable collaboration or sponsored research agreement.University personnel may enable a UMD Gmail account on multiple devices including mobile phones. To prevent accidental use of a personal email address when conducting University Business, it is strongly recommended that an Approved Email System is used as the default outbound setting on devices.Top(The prior text links to https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport#top)︗ImplementationEach University administrative, academic, and programmatic unit must establish priorities and timetables to decommission their legacy email systems and transition their users to the UMD email system before June 30, 2020. Units were to communicate their plans to the Division of Information Technology at emailconsolidation@umd.edu before November 30, 2019.Subject to approval by the respective relevant unit heads and deans, the use of legacy email addresses of the form @[unit].umd.edu may continue for both inbound and outbound email as long as this email is sent and delivered by an Approved Email System.Top(The prior text links to https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport#top)︗Applies ToAll members of the University Community who conduct University Business via email. Excludes TERPmail, which is the University of Maryland's institutional student platform for communicating academic information and providing cloud storage and productivity and collaboration tools. All students and accepted applicants may be granted a TERPmail address.Top(The prior text links to https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport#top)︗Procedures︗WaiverA unit that has unique business requirements that cannot be met by the Institutional Email must submit a waiver form(The prior text links to https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=bdd496badb448c903fb0d92b5e961907) explaining, in detail, how conformance with this Standard would be noncompliant with federal or state laws. For example, University personnel conducting classified work are required to use an email system that meets federal government statutory or contractual requirements in specific situations. Waivers must be requested by a unit head responsible for overseeing the administrative, academic, or programmatic unit and approved by the respective Dean or Vice President and the Division of Information Technology. The Division of Information Technology VP/CIO may grant waivers to this security Standards for a period of up to 3 years (with the option for renewal). Consistent with the UMD Policy on Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources(The prior text links to https://www.president.umd.edu/administration/policies/section-x-miscellaneous-policies/x-100a), a waiver may be revoked at any time by the VP/CIO.Waivers to forward Intuitional Email to U.S. federal agencies when required by contract, may be granted by the CIO in consultation with the Office of General Council. Top(The prior text links to

Please note you will need to create a Gitlab personal access token(The prior text links to https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md) with the api scope and use this access token for the password when you run the login command.(fork the repo)git clone git@gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu:username/gpudocker.gitcd gpudockerdocker login -u username registry.umiacs.umd.edudocker build -t registry.umiacs.umd.edu/username/gpudocker .docker push registry.umiacs.umd.edu/username/gpudockerIf you are using a UMIACS supported system, Docker will not be installed. Please use Podman instead.  You can simply substitute podman in place of docker in the above commands, however you may also need to set up your storage.conf file.︗NoneYou can then download the image and run it on any cluster that we support Apptainer (formerly Singularity) on.First, choose a location with enough space for both the cache / tmp and the resulting image.  For this example, the image baseline requires 9.1GB of space for these two things, which makes your home directory not a good candidate.  We suggest using either a local or network scratch directory.export WORKDIR=/fs/nexus-scratch/usernameexport APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${WORKDIR}/.cacheexport APPTAINER_TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/.tmpmkdir -p $APPTAINER_CACHEDIRmkdir -p $APPTAINER_TMPDIRThen from this work directory (cd $WORKDIR), you can pull the image from your repository.  This will take a bit of time to pull the initial image the first time.apptainer pull gpudocker.sif docker://registry.umiacs.umd.edu/username/gpudockerNow you can run commands using this image.  Please note that you need to pass the --nv flag to apptainer to map the GPUs you have access to outside of the container.$ apptainer exec --nv gpudocker.sif nvidia-smiThu Apr  9 11:45:16 2020+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+| NVIDIA-SMI 440.44       Driver Version: 440.44       CUDA Version: 10.2     ||-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.
