Please follow this link for more information on this - Ivanti Secure Access Client.A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. UMIACS currently provides VPN access through a Ivanti Connect Secure (https://www.ivanti.com/products/connect-secure-vpn)  SSL VPN to all users except  class accounts.Please note that enrollment in our MFA is mandatory to connect using the UMIACS VPN. Enrollment steps can be found  here.Section: Contents1 Getting Connected1.1 Client Setup1.2 VPN Troubleshooting1.3 Multi-Factor AuthenticationSection: Getting ConnectedOnce connected to the VPN you can use the  Remote Desktop client to access a Windows machine, as well as access a number of other non-public UMIACS resources.Section: Client SetupOperating Systems:Configuring a Windows VPN ConnectionConfiguring a macOS VPN ConnectionConfiguring a Linux VPN ConnectionMobile Devices: Configuring a Mobile (iOS/Android) deviceSection: VPN TroubleshootingTroubleshoot common VPN issuesSection: Multi-Factor Authentication Configuring Multi-Factor authenticationRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Network/VPN&oldid=11854"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/BarracudaSpamFirewall/Scoring has the title Section: BarracudaSpamFirewall/Scoring and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchOur  Barracuda spam firewalls will score every message that passes through them based on a number of internal rules and inject message headers into the message based on the outcome/action taken.

There is a Room PC ("PC Main"), a Solstice Pod ("Solstice"), and an HDMI cable to use a laptop or external device ("Laptop").There is also an "Audio Override" output device that you can project any of the input sources to. This decouples the source audio from the source video so that you can send audio from one source to the audio output while maintaining video from a difference source. The primary use of this is to be able to prevent echoing and have teleconferencing participants be able to hear the room audience when using both a laptop and the room PC to present. With both devices in the same teleconference session, leave "Laptop" as the source video and switch the audio override to "PC Main" to display what is on the laptop but use the microphones spread throughout the room to hear the audience.Section: SourcesSection: Room PCUse the wireless keyboard/mouse combo on the desk in the room to use the room PC.

Below are some helpful tips and practices that will make it easier to distinguish between legitimate UMIACS staff messages and phishing attempts.Section: Legitimate Mail from StaffThe UMIACS intranet site, intranet.umiacs.umd.edu (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu)  will always have a posted announcement of any administrative actions we wish all UMIACS users to take collectively. We suggest manually typing this address into your browser or having a bookmark for this site. This URL should also always be SSL-secured. Please check that your browser is reporting a secure connection when visiting the site. This will always be the case for any URL in the *.umiacs.umd.edu domain.When we do send out requests for advisory and mandatory actions for a user they will usually be signed with a staff member's GPG key. We provide a tool called Verify Staff GPG Messages from the UMIACS intranet site (also linked below). This allows you to paste the text of the message and confirm that the sender is legitimate. Please note that other communications that are initiated by users through our Jira ticket system or in response to these tickets will not be signed.Verify Staff GPG Messages (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/gpg/verify) Section: Some Telltale Signs of PhishingThe above steps should ensure that you are properly able to identify legitimate messages sent by staff. Below are some additional generic signs that should help identify phishing attempts.Bogus to and from addresses (not within the UMIACS or UMD domains)Message not directly referencing you by name (e.g. "Hello user" or "Hello researcher")Sender of message demanding that action be taken immediately or consequences will occur (without an appropriate GPG key included)Poor grammar and spelling in the messageHyperlinks pointing to different locations than they claim to or shady attachments being included with the messageWARNING: Do NOT click on any links or open any attachments in a message you suspect to be a phishing attempt, as these may lead to the execution of malicious programs on your machine. Instead, hover over links to check where they really point to.If you ever have questions about the legitimacy of a message, please contact the  Help Desk and we can verify whether or not it was sent out by staff.Section: If You Have Fallen VictimIf you believe you've fallen victim to a phishing attack or otherwise believe your account may have been compromised, please contact the  Help Desk immediately. The sooner we know about any potential issues, the sooner we can take preventive measures to make sure as little harm is done as possible. This typically will involve a password change as well as possibly locking out access to your account for some period of time while we ensure your account is secure.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Phishing&oldid=11249"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Nexus/Gamma has the title Section: Nexus/GAMMA and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from Nexus/Gamma)Jump to navigationJump to searchThe GAMMA (https://gamma.umd.edu/)  lab has a partition of GPU nodes available in the Nexus.

It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.Section: Project DirectoriesYou can request project based allocations for up to 8TB and up to 180 days with approval from a GAMMA faculty member.  To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that approved the project in the conversation.  Please include the following details:Project Name (short)DescriptionSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)Length in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if anyThese allocations will be available from /fs/gamma-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation (requires re-approval from a GAMMA faculty member).If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.This data is backed up nightly.Section: Scratch DirectoriesScratch data has no data protection, there are no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories:Network scratch directoryLocal scratch directoriesSection: Network Scratch DirectoryYou are allocated 100GB of scratch space via NFS from /gammascratch/$username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.This directory is automounted so you may not see your directory if you run ls /gammascratch but it will be mounted when you cd into your /gammascratch directory.You may request a permanent increase of up to 200GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 200GB, you will need faculty approval. This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.Section: Local Scratch DirectoriesThese file systems are not available over NFS and there are no backups or snapshots available for these file systems.Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These directories are local to each node, ie. the /scratch0 on two different nodes are completely separate.These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.Gamma has invested in a 20TB NVMe scratch file system on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu that is available as /scratch1.  To utilize this space, you will need to copy data from/to this over SSH from a compute node.  To make this easier, you may want to setup SSH keys that will allow you to copy data without prompting for passwords.The /scratch1 directory on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu doesn't have a tmpwatch. The files in this directory need to be manually removed once they are no longer needed.Section: DatasetsWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/gamma-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.The list of GAMMA datasets we currently host can be viewed here (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=GAMMA) .Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus/GAMMA&oldid=11906"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/PrinterTroubleshooting has the title Section: PrinterTroubleshooting and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Common Printing Error SolutionsIf you are having trouble trying to print a PDF, try the following: Choose File >>> Print, and then click Advanced.Click to enlarge imageSelect the Print As Image check box, and click Ok.

Faculty may request that a class be supported by following the instructions  here.Section: Getting an accountYour TA or instructor will request an account for you. Once this is done, you will be notified by email that you have an account to redeem.  If you have not received an email, please contact your TA or instructor. You must redeem the account within 7 days or else the redemption token will expire.  If your redemption token does expire, please contact your TA or instructor to have it renewed.Once you do redeem your account, you will need to wait until you get a confirmation email that your account has been installed.  This is typically done once a day on days that the University is open for business.Any questions or issues with your account, storage, or cluster use must first be made through your TA or instructor.Section: Registering for DuoUMIACS requires that all Class accounts register for MFA (multi-factor authentication) under our Duo instance (note that this is different than UMD's general Duo instance). You will not be able to log onto the class submission host until you register.If you see the following error in your SSH client, you have not yet enrolled/registered in Duo.Access is not allowed because you are not enrolled in Duo. Please contact your organization's IT help desk.In order to register, visit our directory app (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory)  and log in with your Class username and password. You will then receive a prompt to enroll in Duo. For assistance in enrollment, please visit our  Duo help page.Once notified that your account has been installed and you have registered in our Duo instance, you can SSH to nexusclass.umiacs.umd.edu with your assigned username and your chosen password to log in to a submission host.If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:nexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edunexusclass01.umiacs.umd.eduSection: Cleaning up your account before the end of the semesterClass accounts for a given semester are liable to be archived and deleted after that semester's completion as early as the following:Winter semesters: February 1st of same yearSpring semesters: June 1st of same yearSummer semesters: September 1st of same yearFall semesters: January 1st of next yearIt is your responsibility to ensure you have backed up anything you want to keep from your class account's personal or group storage (below sections) prior to the relevant date.Section: Personal StorageYour home directory has a quota of 30GB and is located at:/fs/classhomes/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>where <semester> is either "spring", "summer", "fall", or "winter", <year> is the current year e.g., "2021",  <coursecode> is the class' course code as listed in UMD's Schedule of Classes (https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/)  in all lowercase e.g., "cmsc999z", and <username> is the username mentioned in the email you received to redeem the account e.g., "c999z000".You can request up to another 100GB of personal storage if you would like by having your TA or instructor  contact staff. This storage will be located at/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<username>Section: Group StorageYou can also request group storage by having your TA or instructor  contact staff to specify the usernames of the accounts that should be in the group. Only other class accounts in the same class can be added to the group. The quota will be 100GB multiplied by the number of accounts in the group and will be located at/fs/class-projects/<semester><year>/<coursecode>/<groupname>where <groupname> is composed of:the abbreviated course code as used in the username e.g., "c999z"the character "g"the number of the group (starting at 0 for the first group for the class requested to us) prepended with 0s to make the total group name 8 characters longe.g., "c999zg00".Section: Cluster UsageYou may not run computational jobs on any submission host.  You must  schedule your jobs with the SLURM workload manager.  You can also find out more with the public documentation for the SLURM Workload Manager (https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html) .Class accounts only have access to the following submission parameters in SLURM:--partition - class--account - class--qos - default, medium, and highYou must specify at least the partition parameter manually in any submission command you run. If you do not specify any QoS parameter, you will receive the QoS default.You can view the resource limits for each QoS by running the command show_qos. The value in the MaxWall column is the maximum runtime you can run a single job for each QoS, and the values in the MaxTRES column are the maximum amount of CPU cores/GPUs/memory you can request for a single job using each QoS.Please note that you will be restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM across all jobs you have running at once. This can be viewed with the command show_partition_qos.Section: ExampleHere is a basic example to schedule a interactive job running bash with a single GPU in the partition class, with the account class, running with the QoS of default and the default CPU/memory allocation/time limit for the partition.bash-4.4$ hostnamenexusclass00.umiacs.umd.edubash-4.4$ srun --partition=class --account=class --qos=default --gres=gpu:1 --pty bashsrun: Job time limit was unset; set to partition default of 60 minutessrun: job 1333337 queued and waiting for resourcessrun: job 1333337 has been allocated resourcesbash-4.4$ hostnametron14.umiacs.umd.edubash-4.4$ nvidia-smi -LGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-55f2d3b7-9162-8b02-50de-476a012c626c)Section: Available NodesYou can list the available nodes and their current state with the show_nodes -p class command.

There is a Room PC ("PC Main"), a Solstice Pod ("Solstice"), and an HDMI cable to use a laptop or external device ("Laptop").There is also an "Audio Override" output device that you can project any of the input sources to. This decouples the source audio from the source video so that you can send audio from one source to the audio output while maintaining video from a difference source. The primary use of this is to be able to prevent echoing and have teleconferencing participants be able to hear the room audience when using both a laptop and the room PC to present. With both devices in the same teleconference session, leave "Laptop" as the source video and switch the audio override to "PC Main" to display what is on the laptop but use the microphones spread throughout the room to hear the audience.Section: SourcesSection: Room PCUse the wireless keyboard/mouse combo on the desk in the room to use the room PC.

Some things that are publicly accessible are still under copyright and it is important to understand what the restrictions are on any data that you crawl from remotely accessible sites.There are a number of different organizations that still give access to academic institutions (such as UMIACS) through IP based filtering, but have restrictions on crawling.  The services that they provide may also not be adequately built for programmatic crawling.  In this case, these organizations may ban IP addresses or ranges if crawling is observed on those IP addresses or ranges.  This can then prevent other individuals from using these services from the same IP addresses or ranges. In the case of UMIACS, bad behavior on the part of a single user from UMIACS systems can result in all access to a service being banned from UMIACS' public IP addresses.Some examples of databases or sites that may have restrictions on crawling are (not an exhaustive list):University of Maryland Library Resources - https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=326950&p=2194463 (https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=326950&p=2194463) NCBI - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/) You should never try to evade limitations or restrictions imposed by the site or owner for publicly available service that you are looking to crawl.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=WebCrawling&oldid=11648"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Orders has the title Section: Orders and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThe following pages outline the procedures and best practices for creating and requesting orders.Section: Contents1 Requesting UMIACS Orders1.1 Important Considerations1.2 Option 1: Using the web form1.3 Option 2: Sending email to staff directly1.4 Option 3: Submitting order within Jira yourself2 When Staff Receives the OrderSection: Requesting UMIACS OrdersBefore proceeding: If the KFS account you plan on charging is owned by the Computer Science Department, please instead consult their FAQ (https://helpdesk.cs.umd.edu/faq/iribe/equipment-peripherals)  for ordering the equipment you want.Section: Important ConsiderationsVerbosity is always preferred to lack of critical details.Ticket descriptions should contain a list of specific items being ordered (provide direct links) unless you're attaching an official quote. Please do not include wishlists or links to carts.If priority shipping is required, please include that in the subject of the email.Section: Option 1: Using the web formFill out the form here (https://businessoffice.umiacs.umd.edu/form/order)  and click Submit. This will automatically generate a ticket for staff to action on.Please note that you need to be connected to either the wired campus network, campus WiFi, the campus VPN (https://terpware.umd.edu/Windows/Title/4010) , or the  UMIACS VPN to access this form.Section: Option 2: Sending email to staff directlyWe offer a simple Form (/umiacs/images/2/24/Ordering_Form.pdf)  that you can fill out and send to orders@umiacs.umd.edu along with any applicable quote(s).  Please make sure that you CC the PI or include the email confirmation for any accounts that require committee approval (e.g., RQS).Otherwise, please follow these instructions.Please CC the PI for the KFS (https://kualifinancial.umd.edu/)  account you want to charge.In the body of your email:Specify the KFS account to charge.Specify the items using links or attached quotes and specify the amount of each item. Please do not use wishlists or carts.Quotes must include any applicable shipping costs.If ordering from numerous vendors:Send one email per vendor. Otherwise, UMIACS staff will separate your request into different emails/Jira tickets after the fact.Specify if you want priority shipping per vendor. If no shipping speed is selected, the lowest cost shipping that still provides tracking will be used.Specify the purpose of the purchase (brief description). If on sponsored funds such as federal grants, the description should also provide how the purchase relates to the purpose of the project.Section: NoneLog into the Jira web interface at https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/portals (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/jira/servicedesk/customer/portals)  and select the UMIACS Orders option.You will be presented with the default ordering screen. Here is a very fictitious example:Please note that Summary, Reporter, Account and PI are mandatory fields.RequesterIf the order is being requested by CBCB, IMD, MC2, QuICS, or RQS, prepend the summary with [CBCB], [IMD], [MC2], [QuICS], or [RQS] respectively.SummaryThis should be of the format "Vendor | Brief Description".If the order must be placed today, this will instead be "PRIORITY TODAY | Vendor | Brief Description".AccountThis should be the account (KFS) to be charged. Please be as specific as possible. Account number is preferred, but if you don't know it, a specific description is OK (e.g., don't say "DRIF" since there are multiple DRIF accounts, instead say "UMIACS DRIF", or "CBCB DRIF", etc.)In the event that a single order has multiple accounts, list them all and specify which items are being charged to what accounts (or what percent of an item is being charged to an account) in the description.PIA PI (Principal Adviser) who has approved the purchase on the KFS account.In some cases, multiple PIs can charge to a single KFS account.DescriptionProvide a description of what you want to buy or provide it in a comment before you submit your order.When possible, provide a link to the item to be purchased.When purchasing through Amazon or a site that provides fulfillment for third party vendors, please state the specific vendor that is providing the item and at what price. This is to prevent errors caused by ordering from a different vendor when the site auto-updates.It's good to be polite with your description. ex - "Hi, please purchase $requestedItems. Here are the links/relevant information: $relevantInformation. Thanks!"Section: When Staff Receives the OrderAs long as the PI is CC'd and all needed information is present, we will go ahead and process the order.You will receive an email to pick up the order(s) when it arrives.If you are sending someone other than yourself, the PI, or someone already CC'd on the ORDERS ticket to pickup the items: Please let us know who that person is prior to having them arrive for pickup.

In many cases IP address are assigned automatically via the DHCP protocol, but it is also possible to manually set an IP address.  If your machine happens to have a manually set IP address that conflicts with that of another host, networking issues may arise.Are you behind a firewall?Some establishments use firewalls to restrict certain types of traffic both in and out of their networks.  If you are having trouble accessing a specific service, this might be the case.  To get around this you can connect to the VPN, or use SSH tunneling.Other useful commands:dig: performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queriedhost: simple utility for performing DNS lookupsnetstat (macOS/Linux/UNIX): shows network statusroute print (Windows): shows network routing tablesSection: Change your default DNS serverPlease see  DNS troubleshooting to change your default DNS server.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Network/Troubleshooting&oldid=11254"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Google_Drive has the title Section: Google Drive and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchGoogle Drive (https://drive.google.com/)  is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google.

To simplify the user experience we will be consolidating authentication into a single new Active Directory domain (UMIACS).  At the end of the consolidation, you will be able to use a single password for all UMIACS services.To prepare for this change, UMIACS staff need to migrate all UMIACS Windows accounts to a new domain. This migration starts by moving your account from our existing Windows Active Directory domain (PC\username) to a new one (UMIACS\username). After this migration is completed we will follow up with an announcement detailing the final steps of the password consolidation process.No files or emails will be lost as part of this migration.​Section: Actions you need to takeLog off your Windows workstation (if you have one) prior to 8am on Saturday, March 24th, otherwise you will be forcibly logged out at this time.Section: Service impact during this MigrationYour password will NOT change.Authentication to the Pulse Secure VPN will not be available during this migration window. Existing sessions will not be terminated, allowing you to continue using the VPN through the migration.  Two days prior to the migration, we will extend the default VPN session limit to 48 hours in order to minimize your disruption. If you require the VPN during this time please make sure you authenticate and maintain your connection before the outage window starts.Windows workstations will be unavailable to log into during this migration window.Exchange email access will be interrupted during this migration window.  Exchange email will be delivered however will not be accessible from phones, Outlook, or Outlook Web Access until after the migration has concluded.Section: After the migration has completedWe will post an announcement on https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu)  when the migration has completed and will also send a follow-up email.Your Windows account format will change from PC\username to UMIACS\username where you are required to specify a domain.

PartitionsThere are two partitions available to general CBCB SLURM users. You must specify one of these two partitions when submitting your job.cbcb - This is the default partition. Job allocations on all nodes except those also in the cbcb-heng partition are guaranteed.cbcb-interactive - This is a partition that only allows interactive jobs; you cannot submit jobs via sbatch to this partition. Job allocations are guaranteed.There is one additional partition available solely to Dr. Heng Huang's sponsored accounts.cbcb-heng - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Huang's purchased GPU nodes. Job allocations are guaranteed.Section: QoSCBCB users have access to all of the  standard job QoSes in the cbcb and cbcb-heng partitions using the cbcb account.The additional job QoSes for the cbcb and cbcb-heng partitions specifically are:highmem: Allows for significantly increased memory to be allocated.huge-long: Allows for longer jobs using higher overall resources.Please note that the partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on the partition-specific nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use.The only allowed job QoS for the cbcb-interactive partition is:interactive: Allows for 4 CPU / 128G mem jobs up to 12 hours in length - can only be used via srun or salloc.Section: JobsYou will need to specify --partition=cbcb and --account=cbcb to be able to submit jobs to the CBCB partition.

This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus) and doesn't provide administrative control to users on them.  While Docker (https://www.docker.com)  is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.Apptainer was previously branded as Singularity.  You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity, however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.Section: Contents1 Overview2 Nexus Containers2.1 Bind Mounts2.2 Shared Containers3 Docker Workflow ExampleSection: OverviewYou can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command.

As security threats have evolved from the operating system to applications we have had to take this step in order to maintain operational security for the Institute. Currently the updates are focused on applications that are exposed to the internet such as web browsers, teleconferencing solutions, Adobe Flash, Java, etc.Ivanti is currently deployed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as  Enterprise supported Windows laptops and home machines.Section: Automated ScanningPatches are deployed during the week leading up to the maintenance window. Specifically, they will always be released on the Wednesday that falls between the 9th and the 15th of every month, and typically in the morning.Desktops will scan for updates to be installed every night sometime between 7pm and 9pm. If you are not logged in during those times, the system will automatically install the patches and reboot if necessary. If you remain active on your system during those times, you will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.Laptops will scan for updates to be installed at least once every day (assuming the laptop is powered on). This will only occur when the laptop has an active Internet connection (wired or wireless). You will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.Installation can be deferred until lock/logoff if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, installation will automatically proceed:Desktops: 24 hoursLaptops: 3 hoursIf a reboot is required after installation finishes, you will receive another pop up. It is highly suggested to reboot right away due to system instability and vulnerability. However, reboot can be deferred for up to 6 days if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, the machine will automatically reboot:Desktops: 24 hoursLaptops: 9 hoursIf you interrupt the installation process between when the first patch begins installing and when the last patch finishes installing, Ivanti may ask to reboot before continuing to install the remaining patches next time it pops up. This is by design. If you would like to avoid multiple reboots on a machine that is used intermittently (such as a laptop), we would recommend starting a manual scan just before you stop using the machine for the night and then letting the machine download and apply all patches overnight. See below section for how to do this.Section: Manual ScanningThis should only need to be done on laptops or home machines in the event that Ivanti has not had a large enough time window to scan your computer recently, but can be optionally done if you see fit. Please note you will need an active Internet connection for this to work, however you do not need to be on the UMIACS VPN.Search for "Security Scan" from the Start menu and click the result that shows up (should show a shield icon). The scan will begin. Patches will be detected and downloaded.Note: The scan may fail on the "Checking for other running scanners" step if Ivanti is already running an invisible scan in the background. If this occurs, wait 10-15 minutes and then retry the scan.After all patches have been downloaded, you will be prompted to allow the install to begin.After all patches have been installed, you may be prompted to reboot.If you do not want to reboot immediately, you can click on the 'Remind me in:' drop down menu and click 'More options...'Click the 'Remind me on' radio button and choose a date and time before the deadline (it will tell you what the deadline is). Then click 'Remind me later'.After reboot, run another scan and verify no patches are detected. If a patch is continually failing, please  contact staff.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Windows_Patch_Management&oldid=10994"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/FTP/OSX/Finder has the title Section: FTP/macOS/Finder and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from FTP/OSX/Finder)Jump to navigationJump to searchFTP services can be accessed from supported machines running macOS.

Subsequently you will receive every day (unless you configure otherwise) a mail at approx. 3:30pm EST from the Barracuda with your quarantine summary. Please note that auto log-in through the link provided in the summary does not work due to a recent firmware upgrade on the Barracudas. Please use the links provided above to log in.Section: ScoringThe Barracudas will score every message that passes through them and inject varying message headers based on that score.  You can then create email filters based on these headers to filter out messages that are tagged as spam by the Barracudas. See BarracudaSpamFirewall/Scoring for more details.Section: QuarantineMail that has been deemed as spam will be kept on the Barracudas in quarantine.  It will not be delivered to your mailbox unless you configure the Barracudas to do so.Your quarantine will be preserved for 21 days.

The classic cp command has a number of edge cases in which it will not copy everything that is expected, so the only time that one should use the cp command is if the copy can be verified, such as if you are moving a single file. The better choice for transferring data is by using tar or gtar.  After transferring files or directories, you can use rsync to check that everything moved correctly and to perform a final sync on changed files.Section: Contents1 Transfer a single file2 Transfer a directory or large amounts of data to another location2.1 Transfer between two different hosts3 Verifying transferSection: Transfer a single fileIf you want to transfer a single file into another directory you can use the cp command.  The format for the cp command is: cp Source Destination. If destination is omitted, it will make a copy of the file(s) in the current directory.To copy the file foo.txt into your home directory's Documents directorycp foo.txt ~/DocumentsTo transfer the file foo.txt from your current directory to another host use scp (secure copy) with <USERNAME>@<FQDN>:<PATH>scp foo.txt USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/DocumentsThis command will copy the file foo from your current directory to the folder Documents located in your home directory on the host example1. To transfer back the file foo.txt from the host example1 to another directory in your current hostscp USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu:~/Documents/foo.txt ~/VideosImportant: The cp command should only be used for small file transfers.  If you try to transfer a large amount it is possible that cp will not copy all the files over properly. To learn more about the cp command type man cp on the in the terminal.Section: Transfer a directory or large amounts of data to another locationIf you want to transfer a whole directory or a large amount of data to another location you can use the gtar command.To combine two files in your current directory in an archive: gtar -cpvf archive.tar file1 file2To re-archive the data back in a different directory, for example Documents in your home directory: gtar -C ~/Documents/ -xpvf archive.tarThis command will archive all files (including those in subdirectories) within the current directory and re-create the files in the directory that you specify.The format for the gtar command for data transfer is:gtar -cpf -  . | gtar -C /dir -xpvf -In this command, the target is a dash '-' which stands for standard output, and the source is a period '.' which is interpreted as all files in your current directory. The standard output is piped to the second command, which has as a source a dash '-' (which the shell interprets as standard input). The output of the first command is piped and becomes the input of the second command. The target directory in your second command is /dir. To transfer all files from your documents to a folder in your home directory called foo: cd ~/Documentsgtar -cpf - . | gtar -C ~/foo -xpvf -When you use this command it will display a list of the files it has transferred.This command will leave Documents the same, but create a full copy of all files and folders from Documents in foo.Note: This command will preserve permissions, attributes, and meta-data of all files transferred.Section: Transfer between two different hostsTo transfer files from the tmp directory on example1.umiacs.umd.edu to the foo directory on your current host:ssh USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu gtar -cpf - /tmp | gtar -C /foo -xpvf -To transfer files from foo directory on your current host to the tmp directory on example1.umiacs.umd.edu:gtar -cpf - /foo/ | ssh USERNAME@example1.umiacs.umd.edu gtar -C /tmp -xpvf -If your data transfer is interrupted, you can use the rsync command listed below to copy the rest of the files without creating doubles of files that have already been transferred.rsync can also be used for the initial transfer of data if you expect the transfer to be interrupted.  Otherwise, this method should not be used as it takes more time and memory.To run rsync to copy files, the format for the command is the same as written below under "Verifying transfer."Section: Verifying transferTo verify that your transfer copied everything you can use the rsync command, which will compare the two directories' contents and will update the files in which it sees differences.The format for the rsync command is:rsync -aH /source/ /targetTo ensure that the files are the same in Documents and foo from the previous example:rsync -aH ~/Documents/ ~/fooThis command will compare the files and directories within Documents to the files and directories within foo.  If there are files within Documents and its subdirectories that do not appear in foo, this command will copy the missing files from Documents to foo.Important: Make sure to include the slash after the name of the source directory, if you do not include it, it will copy the directory folder over as well.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Data_Transfer&oldid=11737"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SetUID has the title Section: SetUID and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSetUID is useful for programs that need root level privileges in UNIX.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SetUID&oldid=2184"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/ServiceDeskMigration has the title Section: ServiceDeskMigration and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 What work is being done?2 What changes can I expect?2.1 Email Requests2.2 Jira Accounts2.3 Orders UpdatesSection: NoneUMIACS Technical Staff will be upgrading the Request Tracker, based on Jira Software, will be upgraded to a new system based on Jira Service Desk.

We don't support Docker in many of our environments as it grants trivial administrative control over the host the Docker daemon runs on.  Podman on the other hand has the ability to run containers in user namespaces.  This means that for every user name space in the kernel you create the processes within it will map to a new uid/gid range.  For example, if you are root in your container, you will not be uid 0 outside the container, but instead you will be uid 4294000000.We still believe that Apptainer is the best option for running containerized workloads on our clustered based resources.  Podman is a good option for developing the containers to be run via Apptainer or building a deliverable for a funding agency.  Please  contact staff if you would like Podman installed on a workstation or standalone server.  More information on Podman running rootless can be found here (https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) .Section: Contents1 Getting Started1.1 Storage2 GPUs3 ExampleSection: Getting StartedTo get started there are a few things that you need to configure.First, run the podman command.  If it says command not found or you get an ERRO like the one below about no subuid ranges, and you are on a workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server, please  contact staff with the error and the host that you are using.  We will need to do some steps to setup the host you want ready.$ podmanERRO[0000] cannot find mappings for user username: No subuid ranges found for user "username" in /etc/subuidError: missing command 'podman COMMAND'Try 'podman --help' for more information.Section: StorageContainers are made up of layers for the image and these are stored in the graphroot setting of ~/.config/containers/storage.conf which by default will be in your home directory.  With our home directories being available over NFS there is an issue (https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs)  that due to the user name space mapping described above you will not be able to access your home directory when you are building the layers.You need to update the graphroot setting to a local directory on the host.  The file ~/.config/containers/storage.conf may not exist until you run podman the first time, however you can manually create it.[storage]  driver = "vfs"  graphroot = "/scratch0/username/.local/share/containers/storage"...When building larger images, it may fill up the default directory for imageCopyTmpDir (/var/tmp). If this happens, you will need to specify a different directory using the environment variable TMPDIR. For example:export TMPDIR="/scratch0/example_tmp_directory"Section: GPUsRunning Podman with the local Nvidia GPUs requires some additional configuration steps that staff has to add to any individual workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server that runs Podman.  This includes ensuring the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed.For example you can run nvidia-smi from within the official Nvidia CUDA containers with a command like this, optionally replacing the tag for different CUDA versions/OS images:$ podman run --rm --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8 nvidia-smiThu Apr 16 18:47:04 2020+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     |+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

These are the steps required to accept the certificate:Click UMIACS Certificate Authority (https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/images/7/7d/CA-cert.crt)  to download the file.Open the file and click "Install Certificate".In the dialog box opened, click "Next".Choose "Place all certificates in the following store".Choose "Browse", in the dialog box opened, Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".Click "Next" and then "Finish".If you get a Security Warning asking if you want to install this certificate, click "Yes".You should receive a success message similar to the following:You may need to restart your browser for the change to take effect.Section: NoneFor most macOS browsers (excluding Firefox), certificate authorities are handled by macOS itself. This process requires administrator access. If you do not have administrator access and you are using a UMIACS-supported Mac, please contact Staff. Otherwise, here are the steps required to accept the certificate:Click UMIACS Certificate Authority (https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/images/7/7d/CA-cert.crt)  to download the file.Open Keychain Access (Located in the Others group in Launchpad)Go to the Systems > CertificatesOpen the UMIACS Certificate Authority file by double-clicking it (should be located in your downloads folder).Enter your administrator password or use your fingerprint on the dialog box that appears.Right-click the certificate that was just added and select the "Get Info" section.Select "Always Trust" option in the "When using this certificate" dropdown ("Trust" > "When using this certificate" > "Always Trust")Close the certificate and keychain access window.Enter the administrator credentials to add this certificate for all users of the systemYou may need to restart your browser for the change to take effect.Section: NoneIf you are using a browser other than Firefox in Unix, the process is more complicated than the above methods and may depend on your particular Unix distribution. If you need assistance with this please contact UMIACS Staff.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=AddingUMIACSCertificateAuthority&oldid=11521"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/UMobj/Example has the title Section: UMobj/Example and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchIn your shell, export the credentials if not already done (substituting in your actual ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY for your personal account or  LabGroup in the Object Store (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/user/) ).export OBJ_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<ACCESS_KEY>"export OBJ_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<SECRET_KEY>"export OBJ_SERVER="obj.umiacs.umd.edu"We will be uploading this 4.4GB file.# stat CASIA-WebFace.tar.gz  File: `CASIA-WebFace.tar.gz'  Size: 4018119666      Blocks: 7847896    IO Block: 262144 regular fileDevice: 13h/19d Inode: 87161       Links: 1Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (10001/username)   Gid: (18001/groupname)Access: 2015-11-24 19:34:05.715695000 -0500Modify: 2015-11-23 14:23:35.872087000 -0500Change: 2015-11-23 16:07:10.062306000 -0500If the bucket does not exist yet you need to create the bucket first.# mkobj janus_datasets:Created bucket janus_datasets.Now you can copy the file to the bucket.# cpobj CASIA-WebFace.tar.gz janus_datasets:100% |#########################################################################################################################################|To verify the object store has the data expected we can compare the checksums.

To access them, you have to be using a University owned computer. Please note that only Matlab versions R2020a and newer are supported by the University's license server.If you would like to install the institutional version of Matlab on a self-supported machine, please  contact staff and we can provide you install media.Section: Contents1 Linux2 Windows3 macOS4 License Information4.1 Toolbox Shortnames5 Matlab CustomizationsSection: LinuxModules are the preferred way to interact with Matlab on UMIACS-supported Linux machines. The Modules page will provide information on adding Matlab into your environment and using it.Section: WindowsAll UMIACS-supported Windows machines should come with a pre-installed version of Matlab. Please  contact staff if you would like a later version installed.Section: macOSPlease  contact staff if you would like Matlab installed on a UMIACS-supported macOS machine.Section: License InformationCampus has a limited number of seats for Matlab itself, as well as the various toolboxes, managed by a cluster of network license servers (https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/administer-network-licenses.html) . As such, you must have network connectivity to be able to use the University's licenses. When calling functions in a toolbox, Matlab will automatically check out a license for that toolbox, making it temporarily unavailable to other users. If, while attempting to use Matlab, you run into a license manager error stating that the maximum number of users for Matlab has been reached, this likely indicates that all of campus' available licenses are in use. To check the number of licenses available for a specific toolbox, please see the below sections:Section: Toolbox ShortnamesThe toolbox names themselves don't always work with licensing commands; rather, Matlab has a set of shortnames which can be passed to these commands.

If this file is present in the current working directory where you launch Matlab, it will be executed. You can perform a variety of tasks using this file. These include (but are not limited to) customizing the window environment, setting variables for later use, and enabling use of 3rd party toolboxes. Alternatively, you can use the userpath env variable to set a path other than the current working directory for startup and 3rd party toolbox locations.

The actual submission hosts are:nexuscml00.umiacs.umd.edunexuscml01.umiacs.umd.eduAll partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone CML cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that cml- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone CML cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named cml in the standalone cluster (it is also named just cml in Nexus).Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:Standalone CML cluster submission commandNexus cluster submission commandsrun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bashsrun --partition=cml-dpart --qos=cml-medium --account=cml-tomg --gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:2 --pty bashsrun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bashsrun --partition=cml-cpu --qos=cml-cpu --account=cml --pty bashsrun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bashsrun --partition=cml-scavenger --qos=cml-scavenger --account=cml-scavenger --gres=gpu:4 --pty bashCML users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on CML nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the cml-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all cml## nodes in aggregate plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named cml.Please note that the CML compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. CML users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the cml-scavenger partition (i.e., all cml- partition jobs (other than cml-scavenger) can preempt both cml-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and cml-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).Section: PartitionsThere are three partitions available to general CML SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.cml-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed.cml-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other cml- partitions are ready to be scheduled.cml-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.There are two additional partitions available solely to specific faculty members and their sponsored accounts.cml-furongh - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Furong Huang's purchased A6000 node. Job allocations are guaranteed.cml-zhou - This partition is for exclusive priority access to Dr. Tianyi Zhou's purchased nodes. Job allocations are guaranteed.Section: AccountsThe Center has a base SLURM account cml which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in the cluster have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster, which provides a number of guaranteed billing resources corresponding to the amount that they invested.If you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the cml account, which only has access to the cml-cpu, cml-default, and cml-medium QoSes (see below section).If you need access to a different QoS, or if the cml account is at its billing limit (see below in this section), please use your faculty sponsor's account if they have one available. However, keep in mind that if you use your faculty sponsor has their own named partition (see previous section), using the faculty-specific account in the cml-dpart partition may block access to resources in the faculty-specific partition, since the billing limit for the account is charged regardless of what partition is being used.The current faculty accounts are:cml-abhinavcml-cameroncml-furonghcml-hajiaghacml-johncml-ramanicml-sfeizicml-tokekarcml-tomgcml-zhou$ sacctmgr show account format=account%20,description%30,organization%10             Account                          Descr        Org-------------------- ------------------------------ ----------                 ...                            ...        ...                 cml                            cml        cml         cml-abhinav      cml - abhinav shrivastava        cml         cml-cameron            cml - maria cameron        cml         cml-furongh             cml - furong huang        cml        cml-hajiagha      cml - mohammad hajiaghayi        cml            cml-john           cml - john dickerson        cml          cml-ramani        cml - ramani duraiswami        cml       cml-scavenger                cml - scavenger        cml          cml-sfeizi             cml - soheil feizi        cml         cml-tokekar           cml - pratap tokekar        cml            cml-tomg            cml - tom goldstein        cml            cml-zhou              cml - tianyi zhou        cml                 ...                            ...        ...Faculty can manage this list of users via our Directory application (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/)  in the Security Groups section.

Please include the following details:Project Name (short)DescriptionSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)Length in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if anyThese allocations will be available from /fs/cml-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 120 days (requires re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML).  If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.This data is backed up nightly.Section: Scratch DirectoriesScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up.

Space increases beyond 800GB also have a maximum request period of 120 days (as with project directories), after which they will need to be renewed with re-approval from a CML faculty member and the director of CML.As with project directories, allocations over 3TB total space require approval from the director of CML (https://ml.umd.edu/#team)  in addition to your faculty member.This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.Section: Local Scratch DirectoriesEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.Section: DatasetsWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/cml-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.The list of CML datasets we currently host can be viewed here (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=CML) .Section: ModelsWe have read-only model storage available at /fs/cml-models.

To simplify the user experience we will be consolidating authentication into a single new Active Directory domain (UMIACS).  At the end of the consolidation, you will be able to use a single password for all UMIACS services.To prepare for this change, UMIACS staff need to migrate all UMIACS Windows accounts to a new domain. This migration starts by moving your account from our existing Windows Active Directory domain (PC\username) to a new one (UMIACS\username). After this migration is completed we will follow up with an announcement detailing the final steps of the password consolidation process.No files or emails will be lost as part of this migration.​Section: Actions you need to takeLog off your Windows workstation (if you have one) prior to 8am on Saturday, March 24th, otherwise you will be forcibly logged out at this time.Section: Service impact during this MigrationYour password will NOT change.Authentication to the Pulse Secure VPN will not be available during this migration window. Existing sessions will not be terminated, allowing you to continue using the VPN through the migration.  Two days prior to the migration, we will extend the default VPN session limit to 48 hours in order to minimize your disruption. If you require the VPN during this time please make sure you authenticate and maintain your connection before the outage window starts.Windows workstations will be unavailable to log into during this migration window.Exchange email access will be interrupted during this migration window.

By default, use of SSH brings the user to a terminal, but the protocol can be used for other types of data transfer such as SFTP and SCP.Section: Contents1 Connecting to an SSH Server2 X11 Forwarding3 SSH Tunneling4 SSH Keys (and Passwordless SSH)5 Verify remote host SSH fingerprint5.1 Windows / PuTTY Verification5.2 Other Platforms6 Long Running Processes7 Further InformationSection: Connecting to an SSH ServerUnder Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus.# ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduNote: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.This will give you access to a terminal on any one of the Nexus servers.  Note that by default you will not have access to applications that require X11 to run.All UMIACS-supported Windows hosts are installed with PuTTY (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) . If you are using a self-supported machine, you can either download and install PuTTY yourself, or if you are running a currently supported version of Windows (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education) , you can install the OpenSSH client natively in Windows by following Microsoft's instructions here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) . Only the client is needed and not the server.Section: X11 ForwardingBy default, SSH only gives the user shell access to a host.  Enabling X11 Forwarding allows users to run applications with Graphical User Interfaces.Under Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus using X11 Forwarding. Please note that under macOS, xQuartz (http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)  is required on the client machine to forward X sessions from the remote session.# ssh -Y username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduNote: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.Under Windows, you will need to forward X through VcXsrv (http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)  or another X11 application.If using PuTTY, you will need to enable X forwarding. The option is under Connection > SSH > X11, shown below.If using the Windows Terminal app (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) , you will need to set an environment variable and then relaunch the app.setx.exe DISPLAY "127.0.0.1:0.0"After this has been done, every time you want to use X forwarding, you need to make sure VcXsrv or your other application has been started. If using VcXsrv, there will be an icon in your system tray.You will now be able to use Xwindow programs from your SSH client.Section: SSH TunnelingYou can tunnel one or more ports through an SSH connection such that your packets will look like they are coming from the host you are tunneling to.   This is helpful for services that you would be normally blocked by a firewall.Please see the SecureShellTunneling page for more information.Section: NoneSSH can utilize public key encryption to authenticate and authorize users. This can be considered more secure especially if you secure your private key with a pass-phrase. The keys themselves are not susceptible to brute force attacks like normal passwords over SSH are.Please see the SSH/Keys page for more information.Note: UMIACS still requires multi-factor authentication if you are connecting from the public internet for security reasons. If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.Section: Verify remote host SSH fingerprintThe SSH protocol relies on host keys to verify the identify of a given host.  Each host as a unique key for the various different protocols supported.  When connecting to a remove host for the first time, or when the remote host's local host key configuration has changed, you may see the following prompt:$ ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduThe authenticity of host 'nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.73)' can't be established.RSA key fingerprint is 25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f.Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?It is considered best practice to verify the key fingerprint with the actual key of the host.  UMIACS maintains a reference of SSH key fingerprints available at the following link: https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys) It is important to note that each key type has a different fingerprint.  Depending on your local configuration, your client may prefer a specific type of key.  The following commands can be used to determine the fingerprint of a given key type on a remote host:$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu > key# nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0$ ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f key2048 MD5:25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (RSA)If you have any questions, or notice a discrepancy, please  contact staff.Section: NoneIf you use PuTTY to connect to remote hosts, the prompt will be similar to the following:If the host key reported by PuTTY matches the Documented entry for that host (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/ssh-fingerprints/blob/master/fingerprints) , it is safe to click 'yes'.

Each job submitted to the scheduler is assigned a priority value, which can be viewed in the output of scontrol show job <jobid>.Example:$ scontrol show job 1JobId=1 JobName=bash   UserId=username(13337) GroupId=username(13337) MCS_label=N/A   Priority=10841 Nice=0 Account=nexus QOS=default...Section: Contents1 Pending Jobs2 Priority Factors2.1 Age2.2 Association2.3 Partition2.4 Fair-share2.4.1 GPU partitions2.4.2 CPU-only partitions2.5 Nice valueSection: Pending JobsIf the partition that you submit your job to cannot instantly begin your job due to no compute node(s) having the resources free to run it, your job will remain in the Pending state with the listed reason (Resources). If there is another job already pending with this reason, you submit a job to the same partition, and your job gets assigned a lower priority value than that pending job, your job will instead remain in the Pending state with reason (Priority). If there are multiple jobs pending and your job is not the highest priority job pending, the scheduler will only begin execution of your job if starting your job would not push the begin times for any higher priority jobs in the same partition further back.Lowering some combination of the resources you are requesting and/or the time limit may allow submitted jobs to run more quickly or instantly during times where a partition is under resource pressure. The command squeue -j <jobid> --start can be used to provide a time estimate for when your job will start, where <jobid> is the job ID you receive from either srun or sbatch.You can use the command alias  show_available_nodes with a variety of different submission arguments to get a better idea of what jobs may be able to begin sooner.Section: Priority FactorsThe priority factors in use at UMIACS include:Age of job i.e. time spent waiting to run in the queueAssociation (SLURM account) being usedPartition job was submitted toFair-share of resources"Nice" value that job was submitted withSection: AgeThe longer a job is eligible to run but cannot due to resources being unavailable, the higher the job's priority becomes as it continue to wait in the queue. The priority modifier for this factor reaches its limit after 7 days.Section: AssociationSome lab/center-specific SLURM accounts may have priority values directly attached to them. Jobs run under these accounts gain this many extra points of priority.Section: PartitionThe partition named scavenger on each of our clusters always has a lower priority factor for its jobs than all other partitions on that cluster. As mentioned in other UMIACS cluster-specific documentation, jobs submitted to this partition are also preemptable (https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html) . These two design choices give the partition its name; jobs submitted to the scavenger partition "scavenge" for available resources on the cluster rather than consume dedicated resources, and are interrupted by jobs asking to consume dedicated resources.On Nexus, labs/centers may also have their own scavenger partitions (<labname>-scavenger) if the faculty for the lab/center have decided upon some sort of limit on jobs (number of simultaneous jobs, number of actively consumed billing resources, etc.) in their non-scavenger partitions. These lab/center scavenger partitions allow for more jobs to be run by members of that lab/center on that lab's/center's nodes only, but are preemptable by that lab's/center's non-scavenger partition jobs.In decreasing order of priority (highest first), our priority tiers for partitions are:Account-specific non-preemptable partitionsLab/center-specific non-"scavenger" named partitionsLab/center-specific "scavenger" named partitionsInstitute-wide scavenger partitionA job in a lower priority tier will never have a higher priority value than any job in any of the higher priority tiers.Section: Fair-shareThe more resources your jobs have already consumed within an account, the lower priority factor your future jobs will have when compared to other users' jobs in the same account who have used fewer resources (so as to "fair-share" with other users). Additionally, if there are multiple accounts that can submit to a partition, and the sum of resources of all users' jobs within account A is greater than the sum of resources of all users' jobs within account B, the lower priority factor all future jobs from users in account A will have when compared to all future jobs from users in account B. (In other words, fair-share is hierarchical.)You can view the various fair-share statistics with the command sshare -l. It will show your specific FairShare values (always between 0.0 and 1.0) within accounts that you have access to.

cpu=0,mem=0,energy=0,node=0,b+The actual resource billing weights for the three main resources (memory per GB, CPU cores, and number of GPUs if applicable) are per-partition and can be viewed in the TRESBillingWeights line in the output of scontrol show partition. The billing value for a job is the sum of all resource weightings for resources the job has requested. This value is then multiplied by the amount of time a job has run in seconds to get the amount it contributes to the RawUsage for the association within the account it is running under.The algorithm we use for resource weightings differs depending on if there are any GPUs in a partition or not, and is as follows:Section: GPU partitionsEach resource (memory/CPU/GPU) is given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (33.33% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU/GPU values are adjusted accordingly.Different GPU types may also be weighted differently within the GPU relative billing. A baseline GPU type is first chosen. All GPUs of that type and other types that have lower FP32 performance (in TFLOPS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) ) are given a weighting factor of 1.0. GPU types with higher FP32 performance than the baseline GPU are given a weighting factor calculated by dividing their FP32 performance by the baseline GPU's FP32 performance. The weighting values for each GPU type are then determined by normalizing the sum of all of GPU cards' billing values multiplied by their weighting factors against the relative billing percentage for GPUs (33.33%).The current baseline GPU is the NVIDIA RTX A4000 (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/rtx-a4000/) .Section: CPU-only partitionsEach resource (memory/CPU) is first given a weighting value such that their relative billings to each other within the partition are equal (50% each). Memory is typically always the most abundant resource by unit (weighting value of 1.0 per GB) and the CPU value is adjusted accordingly. The final CPU weight value is then divided by 10, which ends up translating to roughly 90.9% of the billing weight being for memory and 9.1% being for CPU. The division of the CPU value is done so as to not affect accounts' fair-share priority factors as much when running CPU-only jobs given the popularity of GPU computing.Section: Nice valueThis is a submission argument that you as the user can include when submitting your jobs to deprioritize them. Larger values will deprioritize jobs more e.g.,srun --pty --nice=2 bashwill have lower priority thansrun --pty --nice=1 bashwhich will have lower priority thansrun --pty bashassuming all three jobs were submitted at the same time. You cannot use negative values for this argument.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/Priority&oldid=11955"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/KVM has the title Section: KVM and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchKVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although work is underway to get the required changes upstream.Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.The kernel component of KVM is included in mainline Linux as of 2.6.20.The system image for the virtual machine should be on local disk space.  Putting a running virtual machine on networked file space will result in poor performance for both the virtual machine, as well as other users of the filespace.Section: Contents1 Getting Started2 Creating a virtual machine2.1 Initializing the machine2.2 Forwarding Ports2.3 Windows ExampleSection: Getting StartedIn order to start using KVM on your machine, UMIACS Staff will first need to install the requisite packages and set a baseline configuration.  Please  contact staff along with a brief explanation of your goals for running a local virtual machine.  Note: Ubuntu requires you to be in the kvm group on the local host.Once staff has installed the required packages you can then use the program 'virt-manager' to initialize and manager your virtual machines.In a terminal run:virt-manager -c qemu:///sessionThis will bring up a graphical interface which can be used to manage various aspects of your virtual machines.  The network that is available is called usermode networking which provides a NAT connection to the outside world.  See below about forwarding ports using qemu-kvm.Section: Creating a virtual machineSection: Initializing the machineIn virt-manager, highlight 'localhost' and then click the 'New' button.  This will bring up a new window that will guide you through configuring your virtual machine.  For the most part, you should stick with the default options.Section: Forwarding PortsThis functionality is only available by editing the XML file for your domain directly.  Libvirt (http://libvirt.org/drvqemu.html#qemucommand)  has the capability to pass arguments directly to the qemu binary.  First create your VM with virt-manager and then shut it down.  Run in a shell virsh -c qemu:///session which will drop you into the virsh shell.   You can list your VMs both running and off by typing list --all.  Find the name of the VM and type edit NAME where NAME is the name of the VM.You need to replace the <domain> tag in the first line to:   <domain type='kvm' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'>Then you need to insert the following lines directly above the last line which should have the </domain> tag.  In this case the port 2222 will be forwarded to the port 22.   You may specify multiple ports here but each needs its own -redir line and the port specifications.   <qemu:commandline>      <qemu:arg value='-redir'/>      <qemu:arg value='tcp:2222::22'/>    </qemu:commandline>Here is an example forwarding 3389 to 3389 (RDP) when running Windows (you may need to activate RDP within your Windows VM).   <qemu:commandline>      <qemu:arg value='-redir'/>      <qemu:arg value='tcp:3389::3389'/>    </qemu:commandline>Section: Windows ExampleYou can start a windows install with virt-install in a rather automated fashion.  Here is an example using a Windows 10 x64 ISO with 40G disk and 16GB of RAM. Please note that this should spawn virt-viewer automatically and show you the Windows installer screen.virt-install --connect qemu:///session --name=win10 --os-type=windows --network user --disk path=/scratch0/username/win10.img,size=40 --cdrom=/scratch0/username/Win10x64.iso --graphics spice --ram=16384Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=KVM&oldid=10299"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SecureShellTunneling has the title Section: SecureShellTunneling and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Port Forwarding1.1 OpenSSH1.2 PuTTY2 SOCKS Proxy2.1 OpenSSH2.2 PuTTY2.3 Example: SOCKS proxy, Browser configurationSection: Port ForwardingSection: OpenSSHWhen you want to just forward a specific port locally to a remote port with Linux or macOS systems.   This example will create a local port 9999 that will be forwarded to the remote host webserver.umiacs.umd.edu and its port 8000 through the host nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu.        ssh -NfL 9999:webserver.umiacs.umd.edu:8000 nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.eduThis example will create a local port 13389 that will be forwarded to a remote host that is running a RDP client like Windows through the host nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu        ssh -L 13389:my-desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu:3389 nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.eduThe following example outlines how to use SSH tunnel for printing to the UMIACS CUPS server.        ssh $<USERNAME>@nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.edu -T -N -L 3631:print.umiacs.umd.edu:631Once the tunnel is established you can follow the normal  Printing instructions substitution 'print.umiacs.umd.edu' for 'localhost:3631', or print via the a command such as the following:        lpr -H 127.0.0.1:3631 -P $<PRINTER NAME> $<FILENAME>Section: PuTTYWindows users can achieve the same types of tunnels using PuTTY or a similar SSH client. In PuTTY, the port forwarding configuration dialogue can be found under "Connection>SSH>Tunnels".This example will create a local port 8889 that is attached to the remote host clipsm301.umiacs.umd.edu on its port 8000.Section: SOCKS ProxySection: OpenSSHSSH can also tunnel all traffic coming into a certain port through a SOCKS v5 proxy.  Many browsers and some operating systems can be setup to then connect to this proxy to allow them again to look like they are coming from the host name you specify in your SSH command. ssh -ND 7777 nexusclip00.umiacs.umd.eduPlease note: when you configure proxy settings for a browser (or your whole operating system) all the traffic for that browser (or the OS) will be sent through the proxy.  This can have performance implications.Section: PuTTYWindows users can tunnel traffic coming into a certain port through a SOCKS v5 proxy by using PuTTY or a similar SSH client. Many browsers and some operating systems can be setup to connect to this proxy to allow them to look like they are coming from the host name you specify.In PuTTY under Sessions set the Host Name:Then under Connection > SSH > Tunnels enter a port number and set the type of forwarding to "Dynamic" and press add:Click Open and log into the host.As long as this PuTTY window is open and you are logged in, you can use the SOCKS proxy.Please note that when you configure proxy settings for a browser or your whole operating system, all the traffic for that browser or your OS will be sent through the proxy.  This can have performance implications.Section: NoneThere are too many variations here to cover them all, but they all follow the same general pattern and the following example should be generally applicable. We'll use Firefox for this example. Screenshots are from Firefox 37.0.2.Under Preferences > Advanced > Network > Connection > Settings..., choose Manually proxy configuration:.Enter 127.0.0.1 for the proxy.Enter the port you chose earlier for dynamic forwarding (7777 in the example above).Check Use this proxy server for all protocols, and then click OK.NOTE: this will continue to send all browser traffic through your SSH tunnel until the configuration is reverted. The SSH connection must be established for traffic to pass through to the destination network. Firefox has a very useful plugin called "FoxyProxy" that allows conditional proxies to be set up, if you're interested in adding some intelligence/complexity to your proxy configuration.

From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Quotas1.1 RPC Quotas1.2 Tree Quotas2 Calculating Space UsageSection: QuotasSection: RPC QuotasFile systems that support RPC quotad quotas are reported to the user by the quota command.  Home directories that are mounted from our Isilon NAS will support these kinds of quotas.To find out what your current quota is, first run df . to find out what file system you are currently mounted from (in this example it is  data.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username). Please note that the Use% here is for the entire file system and not your user-specific home directory.# df .Filesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted ondata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/usernameThen run quota and that line will list your quota information for that file system.  If you see errors such as "Error while getting quota from ..." you may safely ignore these as some of our file systems do not report quotas correctly.$ quotaDisk quotas for user username (uid 13337):     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   gracedata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username                     24  5138024 5242880              10  10276045 10485760If you have hit your RPC quota and haven't realized it, you may see some strange issues. For example, you will not be able to write-out files (although 'touch' and file concatenation will succeed). Some applications such as vi will throw "FSync" errors. Similarly, commands such as wget will appear to succeed but your files will be zero-length.Section: Tree QuotasAn alternate style of quota management is done through tree quotas that show up in how much space is available in the file system by using the df command to inspect either the current path (no arguments given) or a given path.For example to show my /nfshomes/username home directory quota, I can just use df ~$ df ~Filesystem                                            1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted ondata.isilon.umiacs.umd.edu:/ifs/umiacs/homes/username   5138048    32   5138016   1% /nfshomes/usernameSection: Calculating Space UsageWhen you are looking to diagnose how much space you are using you often want to know how much storage the immediate directories are taking in a certain folder.  The utility to do this is du.  Since *NIX operating systems use the concept of .. for the previous directory simple file globs like .* don't provide exactly what you need since in certain places like your home directories there are a lot of dot files or hidden files (eg. .somename).  To identify all files and directories from the current directory you can use something like du -hs .[^.]* *.-bash-4.2$ du -hs .[^.]* *48K     .bash_history94M     .cache160K    .compiz3.0M    .config32K     .gconf64K     .gnupg48K     .history48K     .ICEauthority4.2M    .local29M     .mozilla224K    .ssh48K     .viminfo48K     .Xauthority48K     .xsession-errors7.2M    catkin_ws32K     Desktop32K     Documents57M     Downloads32K     Music32K     perl532K     Pictures32K     Public32K     Templates32K     VideosRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Quota&oldid=11465"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/MailmanFAQ has the title Section: MailmanFAQ and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 How do I post to a mailing list?2 How do I add users to a mailing list?3 How can someone subscribe without me doing anything?4 Is there an easy way to discard all messages waiting to be reviewed?5 How do I turn off HTML messages/attachments?6 How can I post from 2 or more addresses to a "members-only" list?7 How do I change a member's password or send them their password?8 How can I restrict the list so only authorized persons can post?9 How do I unsubscribe users without them getting an unsubscribe message?10 How do I edit a held message before approving it for the list?11 Why don't some messages get to the list?Section: NoneMembers of a Mailman list can post by sending mail to: list-name@lists.umiacs.umd.eduPlease make sure to substitute list-name for the name of your list.Section: NoneLogin to the mailing list's adminstration page with the admin password for the list.  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/MAILINGLISTNAME (http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admin/MAILINGLISTNAME) Click "Membership Management..." -> Choose "Mass Subscription".In the "Mass Subscriptions" panel, enter one address per line of users you would like to subscribe.Click "Submit Your Changes" button.You can verify by choosing "Membership List" under "Membership Management..." and finding each user's address.After completion, click "Logout".Section: NoneThey just need to go to   http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME (http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/listinfo/LISTNAME) and fill in the form. They can also subscribe/unsubscribe by email by sending to  LISTNAME-subscribeor to unsubscribe,  LISTNAME-unsubscribeIn ALL of the above cases, the user will receive email confirming their action. They need to just reply to the mail for this to take affect.Section: NoneIf you have a list where non members can post but their messages are moderated, you'll have to deal with a lot of spam. After sometime, just a small percentage of them will be good posts. The admindb page has a checkbox that allows you to discard all held messages that are marked Defer. On heavy lists with lots of spam holds, this makes clearing them much faster.To make sure that all mail from non-members is automatically deleted, go to the privacy page followed by the sender-filter sub-page. At the bottom of the page, set to "discard" the value for "Action to take for postings from non-members for which no explicit action is defined."On the same page, at the top, you can do the same thing for postings by members (if your list is moderated such that users can't post).Section: NoneOn the admin page, go to the Content Filtering section.  Change "Should Mailman filter ..." to Yes. If you leave the rest at default values, including Yes for "Should Mailman convert text/html parts to plain text?"your list will only distribute plain text messages with no attachments.Section: NoneIf you're subscribed to a members-only list as USER@umiacs.umd.edu and accidentally post as USER@umd.edu, your message will not go through.The solution is to actually subscribe both addresses to the list, but to disable delivery from all but one of the addresses. So in the above example, I'd subscribe USER@umiacs.umd.edu and USER@umd.edu, but I would disable delivery to USER@umd.edu.You can disable delivery to an address by going to the personal options page for that address and setting "Mail delivery" to "disabled". The list manager can disable delivery to an address by going to the membership page and clicking "no mail" next to the address in question.Section: NoneGo to the Membership Management page, click the address in question. The page that appears allows you to set a user's password or mail them their existing password by clicking on   "Email my password to me"Note all the other options you can set for the user here.Don't forget that members can have their password sent to them anytime they like by clicking the appropriate button on their personal page. There is no need for you to change their password if they forget their password. They just have to go to  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/LISTNAME/USERNAME%40DOMAINNAME (http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/LISTNAME/USERNAME%40DOMAINNAME) e.g.:  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/umiacs/johndoe%40umiacs.umd.edu (http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/options/umiacs/johndoe%40umiacs.umd.edu) Section: NoneTurn on the moderation flag for all your existing users. Go to the Membership Management page, and use the Additional Member Tasks to turn on the mod flag for all users.Then go to Privacy Options -> Sender filters and set the default_member_moderation flag to Yes so that new users are automatically set as moderated.Set the member_moderation_action to Reject and add a nice rejection notice text to the following text box.    Set the generic_nonmember_action to Reject or Discard.Section: NoneBy default, they will not get an unsubscribe message. You need only go to the membership page and click the "unsub" button next to each of their names and press "submit" or go to the Mass Removal subpage under Membership Management and add all the addresses into the  window and click "submit".Section: NoneUse the "forward this message" feature in the admindb page to forward the message to yourself.At the same time, discard the original held message. You may want to do this later, after you're sure the message was properly forwarded to you.Edit the message in your mail reader. You should include a notice in the message explaining that the list moderator has edited the message. Please use proper netiquette!Resend the message to the list using a Resent-To: header containing the list posting address. Also include an Approved: header containing the list's admin password.Section: NoneSome lists may have spam filters turned on by staff to eliminate problems.These filters are under "Privacy options..." -> "Spam filters".The most common of these that will be applied is to restrict posts with [QUAR] in the subject.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MailmanFAQ&oldid=11375"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Network/VPN/Mobile has the title Section: Network/VPN/Mobile and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Prerequisites2 Download and Install the Pulse Secure Client3 Configuring the Client4 Using the ClientSection: PrerequisitesA  full UMIACS accountDevice enrolled with  UMIACS Duo for multi-factor authenticationAn established network connection (mobile data or wireless)Section: Download and Install the Pulse Secure ClientPulse Secure for iOS and Android enables secure connectivity over SSL VPN to internal UMIACS resources.

There are many backup software solutions available, but this article will focus on using Windows' built-in backup tool, File History (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027408/windows-10-backup-and-restore) .We strongly encourage encrypting your backups. Please see BitLocker/PersonalUse for instructions on how to prepare an encrypted portable hard drive to use for backups.Section: PrerequisitesA portable hard drive formatted with the NTFS file system.Any desktop edition of Windows 10/11.Section: ProcedureInsert your portable hard drive into any USB slot and search File History in the start menu to open the Backup settings system settings item.Click Add a drive and select your portable drive.File History is now enabled for the default folders it backs up (all folders in C:\Users\<yourusername>) and will regularly back them up at the default interval (one hour), and keep all differential versions of all files.To include/exclude folders or configure the backup schedule or retention of differential versions, click on More options. You can also manually start a backup from this menu by clicking Back up now.Section: InactivityIf your drive is disconnected for 5 days or more, you will receive the following Windows notification.Simply reconnect the drive and backups will automatically resume at the configured interval.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Windows_Personal_Backups&oldid=10827"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/BitLocker/PersonalUse has the title Section: BitLocker/PersonalUse and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Overview2 Prerequisites3 Initializing the YubiKey and hard drive4 Unlocking the drive4.1 Unlocking the drive with the YubiKey4.2 Unlocking the drive with the recovery password5 Extra configuration5.1 Set up Auto-unlock5.2 Use an encrypted drive as a backup driveSection: OverviewBitLocker can be used on fixed hard drives (i.e. internal to your computer) as well as on portable hard drives (i.e. USB). If you want to hold a secure, offline copy of files that you want to be preserved, BitLocker To Go (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-to-go-faq)  with a portable hard drive with data to be stored and a hardware token as the key can be used together to do so.Section: PrerequisitesA portable hard drive formatted with an NTFS (preferred), FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT file system.Any desktop edition of Windows 10/11 except Home. BitLocker encryption is not included as a feature of Windows 10/11 Home, though encrypted drives can still be accessed via Windows 10/11 Home.A YubiKey security token (https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc) . Other security tokens may work, but this procedure will focus on using a YubiKey.(optional) One or more (2+ strongly preferred) blank USB flash drives at least 500MB in size, formatted with any Windows-writable file system.Section: Initializing the YubiKey and hard driveLog in locally to the machine you wish to use for encryption. This procedure will not work over Remote Desktop.Download and install the YubiKey personalization tool (https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-personalization-tools/) . Choose the first option (not the command line interface version). If you are using a UMIACS-supported workstation, please contact  UMIACS Staff to install this on your machine.Insert your YubiKey into any USB slot on the machine you wish to use for encryption and launch the personalization tool. Select Static Password at the top and then Advanced.Select Configuration Slot 2(*) and change the password length to 48 chars. Then click all three Generate buttons in order to generate the identities and the secret key and finally Write Configuration. Click cancel (do not save) on the prompt that pops up to save the .csv file, as this saves the Public Identity, Private Identity, and Secret Key in plaintext. Ensure that "YubiKey has been successfully configured" is output in the Results window, and then click Exit in the top right to exit the tool.(*) NOTE: The YubiKey token has two configuration slots. These are nearly functionally identical, but the key difference for the sake of this document is that Slot 2 requires you to hold the sensor on the device down for 2 seconds in order to activate, whereas Slot 1 instantaneously activates when you touch the sensor. We recommend using Slot 2 so that you do not mistakenly emit the password configured below. If you are already using Slot 2 on your YubiKey, slot 1 can still be used.Insert your portable hard drive into any USB slot and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.Expand Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go by clicking the arrow on the right and then click Turn on BitLocker on the portable hard drive.BitLocker will initialize for a few seconds and then pop up with a menu asking how you want to unlock the drive. Choose Use a password to unlock the drive and physically touch the YubiKey's sensor for 3 seconds to get it to output the password you configured previously in each password field.The menu should automatically advance to asking how you want to back up the recovery key. The recovery key is the only way to get into the encrypted drive if you lose the YubiKey. We strongly recommend the Save to a file option for reasons that we will get into. If you choose to print out the recovery key, store it somewhere safe such as a safe deposit box.Plug in your first USB flash drive and choose to save the file on it.If you previously had anything saved on your portable hard drive before formatting it as part of the prerequisites, choose to Encrypt entire drive. This is the safest way to ensure everything on the drive is protected. Otherwise (if this is a brand new blank drive), leave the default option of Encrypt used disk space only.Leave the default of Compatible mode to better ensure the files on the encrypted drive will be readable from other devices (which may be running earlier versions of Windows) if need be.Continue through the menus and finally choose to Start encrypting.BitLocker will begin encrypting and a separate window will pop up to show you the status. This step will either take a long time if you chose to Encrypt entire drive, or complete very quickly if you chose to Encrypt used disk space only. You do not have to wait for encryption to complete to proceed with the remaining steps, but you do need to wait for encryption to complete before disconnecting the portable hard drive from the machine.Download the portable version of KeePassXC Password Manager (https://keepassxc.org/download/) . Then extract it to your USB flash drive.Launch KeePassXC.exe from the extracted folder and choose to Create new database.Choose descriptive phrases for the Database Name and Description and click Continue.Leave all the options on the next menu at default unless you know what you are doing and have good reason to change them and click Continue.Choose a memorable password and click Done.Choose to save the file on your USB flash drive.In your newly created database, choose to Add a new entry from the top pane.Make the Title something memorable. Open the recovery key text file saved earlier, copy the Identifier into the Username field and the Recovery Key into the Password/Repeat fields. Leave some descriptive text in the Notes section to help clarify which fields are which of the BitLocker attributes. Click OK and then exit out of the database back on the main menu.Delete the recovery key text file permanently (NOT the database file you just created). If you leave the recovery key text file on the USB drive, your encrypted portable hard drive is only as secure as that USB flash drive is, rather than needing both the USB flash drive and the password for the database to access the recovery key.(Optional) Copy the contents of the first USB flash drive onto one or more additional USB flash drives to safeguard against loss of both the YubiKey and any single USB flash drive.Clearly label the USB flash drive(s) and store them somewhere secure, such as a safe deposit box. If you have multiple USB flash drives, store them separately.Your portable hard drive is now securely BitLocker-encrypted, with one or more USB drives serving as access to the recovery key.Section: Unlocking the driveSection: Unlocking the drive with the YubiKeyTo later unlock the drive from the same or a different computer:Physically plug the drive and YubiKey in. Click on the notification you get in the notification area, which will open the unlock menu.Physically touch the YubiKey's sensor for 3 seconds to get it to emit the password. It will automatically unlock afterwards.The drive is now unlocked until it is unplugged again.Section: Unlocking the drive with the recovery passwordTo later unlock the drive from the same or a different computer if you are not in possession of your YubiKey:Physically plug one of your USB flash drives containing a database with the recovery key in.Open the recovery database using the password you set for it and then copy the password for the entry inside of it. This is the recovery key.Physically plug the drive in. Click on the notification you get in the notification area, which will open the unlock menu.Click on More options and then Enter recovery key.Enter the copied recovery key from your database file and click Unlock.The drive is now unlocked until it is unplugged again. If you have lost your YubiKey, we strongly recommend buying a new YubiKey, decrypting BitLocker on the drive, and then repeating the initial procedure to re-encrypt it with the new YubiKey.Section: Extra configurationSection: Set up Auto-unlockBitLocker has the ability to auto-unlock an encrypted drive for a specific user(s) when plugged into a specific computer(s) if so desired. This creates an entry in the Windows registry on each computer's local data storage for each user you turn it on for. The entry stores a copy of the volume master key for the encrypted drive that is itself encrypted with a combination of the user's username and either the user's password, if there is one, or computer credentials.We do not recommend turning this on as it undermines the concept of separation of the unlock methods for the drive from any specific computer. If you do want to turn this on, please ensure the user account(s) that you turn it on for are secure (i.e. have sufficiently complex passwords) and the computer(s) that you turn it on for are in secure locations.To enable auto-unlock for a drive (per user per computer):Insert your already-encrypted portable hard drive into any USB slot, unlock it, and search BitLocker in the start menu to open the Manage BitLocker control panel item.Expand Removable data drives - BitLocker To Go by clicking the arrow on the right and then click Turn on auto-unlock on the portable hard drive.The drive will now auto-unlock when plugged into the computer you are currently on for your user account only. You can turn it off again by clicking on the Turn off auto-unlock option that appears in the same location after clicking the turn on button.Section: Use an encrypted drive as a backup driveOne of the more useful things you may want to do with a BitLocker-encrypted portable hard drive is set up automatic backup to it. This can be done by following the procedure on  this page, though please note you will need to unlock the drive each time when plugging it into a computer, or have configured auto-unlock for that computer, before it is accessible by backup software.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BitLocker/PersonalUse&oldid=10837"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Network/VPN/Linux has the title Section: Network/VPN/Linux and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThe UMIACS VPN is accessible through the Pulse Secure Client.Section: PrerequisitesA  full UMIACS accountDevice enrolled with  UMIACS Duo for multi-factor authenticationAn established network connection (wired or wireless)Section: Connecting through the Pulse Secure clientDownload the client:64 bit Pulse Secure Client .deb for Debian-based Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) (/umiacs/images/6/66/Pulsesecure_22.7.R3_amd64.deb) 64 bit Pulse Secure Client .rpm for Fedora-based Linux (e.g. Red Hat) (/umiacs/images/c/c1/Pulsesecure-22.7-R3.x86_64.rpm) Upon starting the client for the first time it may ask to upgrade the client.

Screen is also capable of separating programs from the shell that initially started it which allows a program to continue running even if the connection to the host has been lost. For this reason screen is typically used when a network connection is unstable and the process must remain running even if an SSH connection has dropped. Screen is also useful when a process may be slow and other processes need to be running. Section: UsageTo invoke screen, simply use the following command in a terminal:# screenAlternatively, to start a program with screen:# screen vi program.cThis will invoke screen and, in the newly-created window, start editing the file program.c in vi.You can have as many screen sessions as you’d like on a single host, however, keeping track of many sessions can become difficult. As a way to solve this screen offers the capability to give each session a unique name when you start it using the following:# screen -S [session name]If you need to end your ssh session, but want your processes to keep running you can detach the screen session with:# screen -dThen exit as normal.If you have multiple screen sessions you can detach and reattach them at any time. To list the current screen sessions running on a host use:# screen -lsThe output will be similar to this:# username@tron02:~$ screen -ls#  There are screens on:# 	26598.screenTest1	(Detached)# 	18457.pts-0.tron02	(Detached)# 2 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-username.To reconnect to a specific screen session you may use either the screen number or name to reconnect using ‘screen -r’# username@tron02:~$ screen -r 26598or# username@tron02:~$ screen -r screenTest1Section: Common Keyboard ShortcutsCtrl-A is the metacharacter for commands in screen; press it before every key command.  Some useful commands in screen:Ctrl-A + c (Creates a new window.)Ctrl-A + d (detach from current session)Ctrl-A + [0-9] (Switches to the window corresponding to the number, window 0 is the first window initialized by screen.)Ctrl-A + " (Presents a selection of screen windows from which to choose.)Ctrl-A + Shift-A Rename the current screen windowCtrl-A + <SPC> / Ctrl-A + <BKSPC> (Switch to the next / previous window.)Ctrl-A + k (Kill the current window.)Ctrl-A + \ (Kill the screen session and all its windows.)See the documentation here (http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.txt)  to see a full list of Ctrl-A commands (Section 5.1: Default Key Bindings).Section: Important NotesIf you start a screen session that will run a program within a session that has only one window, such as by issuing the command # screen program.c then when the program exits the screen session will terminate as well. This has the potential to hide any output you may want from your program since the screen session will exit. To solve this issue you can either make sure your shell is not set to auto-logout, or ensure that you have multiple windows open in the screen session so that it will not terminate when the program exits.Section: .screenrcSimilar to .bashrc, the file .screenrc in a user's home directory can be used to customize a screen session's startup behavior.  Commands listed in this file will be executed upon starting screen, and can be useful to set up your environment to display important information such as the window number and name, the name of the host you're connected to, or altering the key sequences for screen commands.

Use show_qos and show_partition_qos to identify the limit(s) and then use scontrol show job <jobid> for each of your jobs running in that QoS to see the resources they are currently consuming.AssocGrpBilling - The SLURM account you are using has a limit on the overall billing amount available in total for the account.  Use sacctmgr show assoc account=<accountname> where user= to identify the limit, replacing <accountname> with the account you are submitting your job with.  You can see all jobs running under the account and their billing values by running squeue -A <accountname> -O "JobId:.18 ,Partition:.9 ,Name:.8 ,UserName:.8 ,StateCompact:.2 ,TimeUsed:.10 ,NumNodes:.6 ,ReasonList:45 ,tres-alloc:80". The billing value will be part of the tres-alloc string for each job.ReqNodeNotAvail - None of the nodes that could run your job (based on requested partition/resources) currently have the resources to fit your job.  Alternatively, if you also see Reserved for maintenance, there is a reservation in place (often for a  maintenance window).  You can see the current reservations by running scontrol show reservation.  Often the culprit is that you have requested a TimeLimit that will conflict with the reservation.  You can either lower your TimeLimit such that the job will complete before the reservation begins, or leave your job to wait until the reservation completes.SLURM's full list of reasons/explanations can be found here (https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_reason_codes.html) .Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SLURM/JobStatus&oldid=12005"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Vtune has the title Section: Vtune and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThe Intel VTune Amplifier XE Suite is a profiler and performance analyzer for Intel chips.   http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-vtune-amplifier-xe (http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-vtune-amplifier-xe) We have a single floating license that can be checked out for RHEL.

It is simple to set up and highly customizable. At UMIACS, it is the software we recommend to users looking to either record or stream on either their personal computers or in a conference room or auditorium setting.Section: Conference Quick SetupBelow are steps outlining how to start recording or streaming your meetings. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk. Select the source you'd like to route to the computer via the "Shared Media" option on the Crestron control panel. This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.Download (windows zip file) (https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases)  and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.Set up video.Click the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.Ensure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called 'AV Bridge'.Click OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.If the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack's default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.Ensure audio settings look OK.The default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.Keep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.Set up either streaming, recording, or both as follows.Streaming:Go to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).Locate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this.YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard (https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard) , near the bottomTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings (https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings) , at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.Enter your key and hit OK.Click Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom.Recording:Go to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive. We have observed that using external HDDs may introduce dropped frames due to encoding lag because of I/O bottlenecks.Click Start Recording under the Control pane at the bottom.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=ConferenceRooms/Recording&oldid=10082"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/VScode has the title Section: VS Code and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from VScode)Jump to navigationJump to searchVisual Studio (VS) Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)  is a multi-platform source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It can be used with a variety of programming languages and can have its base functionality extended through extensions available via its marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) . The base editor itself is free, but some extensions may require paid subscriptions.Section: Contents1 Cluster Usage1.1 Best Practices1.1.1 Use only as a code editor1.1.2 Do not open large files1.1.3 Clean up when done2 Common IssuesSection: Cluster UsageIt can be convenient when using our SLURM computing clusters to open a connection to a VS Code Server (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server)  session on the submission node(s) that you have access to via VS Code's Remote - SSH extension (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) . Steps to set this up can be found here (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_installation) . Use your UMIACS username and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)  of the submission node you want to connect to. Password authentication does not provide an option to save your password, so for convenience, you may want to set up an  SSH key.For a list of active issues with the Remote - SSH extension, please see Microsoft's GitHub tracker here (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/labels/ssh) .Section: Best PracticesBecause of the multi-tenant nature of our submission nodes, using the Remote - SSH extension to connect to a VS Code Server running on a submission node can have adverse affects on other users simultaneously using the submission nodes if not properly managed. The following is a list of "best practices" that we ask you please follow to minimize the chance of impacting others on submission nodes. We have compiled the list through observation as well as through discussion with users.Section: Use only as a code editorVS Code can perform many common file management operations, such as moving, copying, or deleting files or directories. However, the overhead of providing progress updates / status messages through VS Code's UI can cause load spikes that result in other processes on the submission node (both system-level and other users') slowing down. This is especially the case if operating on thousands to millions of small image or video files. In extreme cases, it can seem as though the submission node is wholly unresponsive.The best way to combat this is to use VS Code as just a code editor as strictly as you can (meaning creating new and/or editing existing source code files only). Use standard command-line programs such as mv/cp/rm in VS Code's terminal window or a separate application's terminal window for local file management instead, or use the techniques advertised  here for larger data transfers between nodes.Section: Do not open large filesFiles that you open in VS Code's text editor on a remote machine through the Remote - SSH extension are loaded entirely into RAM on the remote machine. Because of the persistence of VS Code Server processes, opening several unique files may result in them all remaining in RAM for extended periods of time even if you no longer have tabs open for them in the Tab Bar.As such, please refrain from opening large files (more than a few MB) in VS Code itself on submission nodes. Either use a lighter-weight command-line based text editor such as vim (https://www.vim.org/)  or otherwise on the submission node itself, or first  transfer the files that you would like to open to either a less-used remote machine or your local machine before opening them.If you absolutely need to open one or more large files for a very brief period of time on a submission node, please clean up your server session on that node (see below section) as soon as possible when done.Section: Clean up when doneIf you are done using VS Code for an extended period of time (several hours / overnight), consider manually killing your server session on the submission node when exiting. By default, VS Code Server will keep the processes used by your session active for a few hours after you disconnect, keeping the VS Code Server processes on the submission node you were using alive, despite no longer actively being used.This can be done by opening the Command Palette (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)  (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching "Kill VS Code Server on Host...".Select the submission node you were using and click on it.Wait a few seconds and you should get a message confirming the command went through.The next time you connect to the same submission node, you will have a fresh VS Code session on it.Section: Common IssuesIf you are having trouble SSH'ing to a submission node with VS Code, check if your home directory is full.Connect to one of your Nexus submission nodes via SSH not using VS Code. Remote connect to a serverNavigate to your home directory. cd ~Check if it is full. df -h .If it is full (Avail 0), delete some files to free up at least ~100MB of space.

Having BitLocker integrated with the operating system addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.Data on a lost or stolen computer is vulnerable to unauthorized access, either by running a software-attack tool against it or by transferring the computer's hard disk to a different computer. BitLocker helps mitigate unauthorized data access by enhancing file and system protections. BitLocker also helps render data inaccessible when BitLocker-protected computers are decommissioned or recycled.Official Microsoft documentation can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) Section: BitLocker at UMIACSAll of our supported personal office workstations as well all  enterprise or base-supported laptops and home machines will have BitLocker enabled by UMIACS staff as part of each machine's install process.Section: Recovery Key PromptsOrdinarily, no interaction should be required with BitLocker to keep it in a functional state. However, a few circumstances may lead to BitLocker detecting changes to the system boot information and prevent the computer from reaching Windows. This is by design.Some factors that may cause this (not exhaustive):BIOS or firmware updates -- some manufacturer automatic driver update utilities include these by default - beware!DVDs or USB drives inserted or plugged in during bootMalware on the systemThe first step should always be to disconnect any external devices and then power the machine off and back on. This ensures that the hardware configuration of the machine is the same as it was when UMIACS staff initially enabled BitLocker. If the prompt still pops up, please contact UMIACS staff for further troubleshooting.Section: Temporarily Suspending BitlockerIn the event that you encounter the recovery screen above, after booting back into Windows, follow these steps to ensure the prompt does not appear on subsequent reboots. The first two steps can also be taken proactively if you know you will be making a change that affects BitLocker. (see above)Search for BitLocker in the Start menu and click on "Manage BitLocker".Click "Suspend protection" on the Operating system drive and hit yes to the confirmation prompt.If you are doing something to the computer that would ordinarily trigger BitLocker recovery, perform that operation now. Then after you boot back into Windows, click "Resume protection".BitLocker will resume and commit the current boot configuration.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BitLocker&oldid=11219"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/R has the title Section: R and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThis page contains steps for installing R on Windows.Section: Contents1 Basic Installation2 Customized Options3 Customized Startup Environment4 Opening R scripts with RScriptSection: Basic InstallationTo retrieve the latest version of R from here: http://cran.r-project.org/ (http://cran.r-project.org/) Select "Download R for Windows" from the top of the screenThen click "Install R for the first time" on the first lineThis will take you to a download page, click "Download R<version number> for Windows" to begin the installationNavigate to the directory you downloaded the installer to.Run the .exe and step through the installer.Note: There will be a warning when you start the installer that says the full installation requires administrative privileges, disregard this message.Accept the License Agreement and continue.When prompted, choose an installation folder wherever you would like it within your home directory.Select the components that you wish to install, the defaults for this is fine.If you wish to customize the options for the startup environment then click Yes when prompted and proceed to the below section.

We don't support Docker in many of our environments as it grants trivial administrative control over the host the Docker daemon runs on.  Podman on the other hand has the ability to run containers in user namespaces.  This means that for every user name space in the kernel you create the processes within it will map to a new uid/gid range.  For example, if you are root in your container, you will not be uid 0 outside the container, but instead you will be uid 4294000000.We still believe that Apptainer is the best option for running containerized workloads on our clustered based resources.  Podman is a good option for developing the containers to be run via Apptainer or building a deliverable for a funding agency.  Please  contact staff if you would like Podman installed on a workstation or standalone server.  More information on Podman running rootless can be found here (https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) .Section: Contents1 Getting Started1.1 Storage2 GPUs3 ExampleSection: Getting StartedTo get started there are a few things that you need to configure.First, run the podman command.  If it says command not found or you get an ERRO like the one below about no subuid ranges, and you are on a workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server, please  contact staff with the error and the host that you are using.  We will need to do some steps to setup the host you want ready.$ podmanERRO[0000] cannot find mappings for user username: No subuid ranges found for user "username" in /etc/subuidError: missing command 'podman COMMAND'Try 'podman --help' for more information.Section: StorageContainers are made up of layers for the image and these are stored in the graphroot setting of ~/.config/containers/storage.conf which by default will be in your home directory.  With our home directories being available over NFS there is an issue (https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs)  that due to the user name space mapping described above you will not be able to access your home directory when you are building the layers.You need to update the graphroot setting to a local directory on the host.  The file ~/.config/containers/storage.conf may not exist until you run podman the first time, however you can manually create it.[storage]  driver = "vfs"  graphroot = "/scratch0/username/.local/share/containers/storage"...When building larger images, it may fill up the default directory for imageCopyTmpDir (/var/tmp). If this happens, you will need to specify a different directory using the environment variable TMPDIR. For example:export TMPDIR="/scratch0/example_tmp_directory"Section: GPUsRunning Podman with the local Nvidia GPUs requires some additional configuration steps that staff has to add to any individual workstation or standalone (non-cluster) server that runs Podman.  This includes ensuring the nvidia-container-runtime package is installed.For example you can run nvidia-smi from within the official Nvidia CUDA containers with a command like this, optionally replacing the tag for different CUDA versions/OS images:$ podman run --rm --hooks-dir=/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubi8 nvidia-smiThu Apr 16 18:47:04 2020+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     |+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Currently, at UMIACS, this feature is only supported for Windows hosts using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). If you need to remotely connect to a UNIX host, please see SecureShell. With RDP, you can control your Windows desktop environment through a graphical user interface. Mouse and keyboard movements are transferred over a network to a Windows host running an RDP server, which sends screen refreshes back. To access an RDP enabled machine, you must be on the UMIACS physical network or VPN. You must also be authorized to access and remotely control the host you are requesting. If a remote session is active, it is not possible for another user to log onto the console in-person. Attempting to use RDP when a computer is in use by another user could force the existing user to logoff and lose their work. You should always quit RDP by logging off of the remote computer. Simply quitting the RDP client can cause you to stay logged in and prevent other users from accessing the remote host, even at the physical console.Section: How to ConnectPrerequisites:Connected to the  UMIACS VPN or be within the UMIACS network border.Be a member of the 'Remote Desktop Users' group on the remote machine. Please  contact staff if you do not have remote access to a machine you feel you should.Section: WindowsFor connecting to Windows client over RDP, we recommend the native Windows 'Remote Desktop Connection' client. To start the RDC client, click the "Start'" or "Windows" button on the taskbar. In the menu, navigate to "All Programs," "Accessories," then select "Remote Desktop Connection". Alternatively, you can search for "Remote Desktop Connection" in the Start menu's search field.Once RDC client starts, type the name of the RDP/Windows host you are trying to access. The name should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN), e.g. desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu where desktop is replaced by the name of the desktop you are trying to connect to. At this point, click "Connect" to initiate the RDP session.Upon reaching the Windows Security prompt, enter your UMIACS credentials. Please note that the username must be in the format UMIACS\username, where username is replaced by your UMIACS username. The slash must also be a back slash and not a forward slash. If the username is either not correct or not the desired account, click on "More choices" and select "Use another account". Click "Ok" when you are done.After the connection is started, a warning message may alert you to an identity verification failure. For UMIACS machines, you can ignore this and proceed by checking the box and selecting "Yes".You should now be viewing the remote computer. To terminate the session, you should logout of Windows.To switch between your current host and the remote host, click the minimize or "-" button on the top connection bar. With RDC, the clipboard can be transferred between the remote and current host while the RDC client is running and logged in.Alternatively, you can use the Microsoft Remote Desktop application from the Windows Store, which is available for download here. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab) Open Microsoft Remote Desktop.Click "Add" in the top right corner.Next, click "Desktop - Connect to a PC".Type the name of the RDP/Windows host you are trying to access in PC Name. The name should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN), e.g. "desktop.ad.umiacs.umd.edu". Once you have filled that out, click Save.Now, you should be on a page where you will see the PC you have just added. Double-click the PC and enter your UMIACS credentials. Please note that the username must be in the format UMIACS\username (this must be a back slash and not a forward slash). Then, click Connect.If it asks to "Accept certificate and connect?", press Connect.Section: macOSFor connecting to Windows client over RDP, we recommend the 'Microsoft Remote Desktop' application (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12) .  Another, although less preferred, options is the CoRD client.Open the 'Microsoft Remote Desktop Application' and select '+ New' to create a new device profileFill in the'PC Name' field with the name of the remote host you wish to connect to. If you wish to redirect resources from the remote machine to your local machine, please see the section titled 'Redirecting Resources on Mac' below. Then press the blue add button in the bottom right corner.You will now see the device listed below. Double click it to start the connection.You will then be prompted for the username and password used to log into the remote host. After typing in both the username and password, press the blue continue button.If you see a screen appear that looks like the one pictured below, press the blue continue button. You should then be connected to the remote host.Section: UNIXSection: freerdpIf you are trying to access a Windows host via RDP on an Ubuntu machine, you should use the rdesktop client from the command line. This should be preinstalled, so there is no configuration that needs to happen. To use rdesktop, open a shell prompt and type the following command, replacing values as appropriate: rdesktop -r clipboard:CLIPBOARD -g <GEOMETRY> -d UMIACS -u <USERNAME> <HOSTNAME>Key: <GEOMETRY>: Percent of remote host's screen to mirror on the client<USERNAME>: Your UMIACS username (Do not include domain name)<HOSTNAME>: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN) of the desired remote hostOnce you have connected, you will be directed to a Windows login screen where you can complete the login process.Section: xfreerdpXfreerdp is the replacement for rdesktop included with newer Linux hosts, starting with RHEL7 and Ubuntu 12.04/14.04. You should use the xfreerdp client from the command line. This is preinstalled on these newer hosts. The command for xfreerdp is a bit different than rdesktop. To connect via RDP to a remote host with xfreerdp, type the following command, replacing values as appropriate:  xfreerdp -d UMIACS -u <USERNAME> --plugin cliprdr -g <GEOMETRY> <HOSTNAME>Similar to rdesktop, here is an explanation of the values above:<GEOMETRY>: Percent of remote host's screen to mirror on the client<USERNAME>: Your UMIACS username (Do not include domain name)<HOSTNAME>: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FDQN) of the desired remote hostAs with any of these RDP solutions, closing xfreerdp (using the top bar or using CTRL+C) without logging out could cause considerable problems for other users of the workstation. If you are using a shared workstation, please be sure to logout after you are finished with the remote machine using the Start menu.Section: Redirecting Resources on WindowsResource redirection must be set up before connection is established.Section: Audio RedirectionThis allows the remote desktop to access the audio capture and playback devices on the user's desktop.Click the "Show Options" drop down menuNavigate to the "Local Resources" tabClick the "Settings" button in the Remote audio boxSelect preferred audio preferencesSelect "OKSelect "Connect"Section: Other Resource RedirectionThis allows the remote desktop to access the drives, printers, and video capture devices on the user's desktop.Click the "Show Options" drop down menuNavigate to the "Local Resources" tabClick the "More" button in the Local devices and resources boxClick the checkbox next to the resources you would like to redirectSelect "OK"Select "Connect"Section: Redirecting Resources on MacIf you have already created the PC connection, right click over the PC connection you wish to add resource redirection to, then select 'Edit'.Section: NoneThis allows the remote machine to access specified folders on your local machine.Located halfway down the screen, select the 'Folders' tab.Check the box titled 'Redirect folders,' if not checked alreadyEither select the folder(s) already listed you wish to access from the remote machine by checking the box next to the desired folder, or select the '+' button, then import and select the folder(s) you wish to access.Press the blue 'Add' button in the bottom right corner, or if you wish to direct other resources as well, see 'Other Resource Redirection' below.Section: Other Resource RedirectionThis will allow for camera, printer, and/or microphone access to be shared between machines.Located halfway down the screen, select the 'Devices and Audio' tab.Ensure the boxes next to the services you would like to redirect are checked.  For video, ensure that the 'Microphone' and 'Camera' boxes are checkmarked.  For printer access, ensure that the 'Printers' box is checkmarked. Please be mindful to keep 'Clipboard' checkmarked, as that is what allows you to copy and paste between your local machine and the remote machine.Press the blue 'Add' button in the bottom right corner.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Remote_Desktop&oldid=11590"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Jekyll has the title Section: Jekyll and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchJekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/)  is a blog-aware, static site generator.

Public-facing hosts are hosts that are reachable via the Internet (e.g. via ping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) ) without first establishing a connection to our VPN. If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border).SSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and  public key authentication. Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor)  hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically. Other hardware tokens such as a YubiKey (https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/)  or Duo's own hardware token (https://guide.duo.com/tokens)  will still work.Section: ExampleThe initial command or session setup for connecting to a host with multi-factor authentication enabled over SSH is the same as one that does not have it enabled. Our example for connecting to a host over SSH can be found  here. In the below example, we are also SSH-ing to a Nexus node e.g. ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduOnce you enter the command (if using a native terminal) or start the session (PuTTY or other terminal emulators), you will be presented with the following prompt:Password:Enter your UMIACS password here (the same as if you were using interactive password authentication to connect to an internal host). After correctly entering your password, you will be taken to the following prompt. Please note: The options shown here will vary depending on what/how many devices you have registered with our Duo instance. In this example, we have a mobile phone that has the Duo app installed, a tablet (iPad) that has the Duo app installed, a Duo hardware token, and a YubiKey all registered against our UMIACS Duo instance.Password:Duo two-factor login for usernameEnter a passcode or select one of the following options: 1.

As mentioned previously, you do not need an additional multi-factor authentication step when using SSH if you first connect to our VPN since it is already secured by multi-factor authentication.An alternative would be to use a terminal multiplexer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer)  such as Screen or Tmux to minimize the number of times you need to multi-factor authenticate. Terminal multiplexers allow you to start several different processes out of one terminal display, and also detach from and later reattach to each of the processes.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SecureShell/MFA&oldid=11513"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/FileTransferProtocol has the title Section: FileTransferProtocol and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchOur FTP service is deprecated in favor of the UMIACS Object Store.

The only main difference between the two is that HDMI transfers sound natively, while with VGA you will need to connect an additional 3.5mm audio cable. With either approach, the general steps are as follows:Connect your cable of choice to the device you wish to display on the screen.You may need an adapter if you are using a laptop.Connect the other end of the cable to the wall port (usually located opposite of the TV).If you do not see your device automatically appearing on the TV, you may need to turn on the TV or adjust the input of the TV (both done using the remote). If you do not currently have a remote for your TV, you can get one from the UMIACS Help Desk.To adjust the input of the TV, click the source button on the remote, located between the volume and channel buttons, and select the proper input named HDMI 1.Once you connect your device, there are different display modes that can be chosen. Some operating systems may have additional nonstandard options which are described on the individual display mode pages listed below. The following is a description of the basic two modes that all operating systems have:Mirror: Displays the same screen on both your computer and the TV.Extend: Will use the TV as a second screen which you can access by moving your mouse off your current display.If you wish to change your display mode, you can click on the appropriate link below to see a detailed how-to complete with pictures for your particular operating system: Windows Change Display Mode macOS Change Display Mode RHEL Change Display ModeSection: Displaying Still Images and Playing a Slide ShowThere is a USB port on the back of the TV that can be used to display still images or play a slideshow. To be able to follow this guide, you must have a remote which you can pick up from the UMIACS Help Desk if you do not already have one. Now that you have a remote, follow these steps:Upload all of the pictures that you want the TV to display onto a flash drive and plug the flash drive into the USB port on the TV (located around the right edge).Click the source button on the remote and navigate to the MagicInfo S option if it is not already there.You should now see Player in the top left of your screen. If you do not, either click on the player option if you see one in the menu or click the return button on your remote. Now you should see Player in the upper left of your screen.Directly below the word Player, there is a dropdown menu that says Internal Memory. Navigate to it and change it to the name of your USB using the remotes navigation buttons.You can now navigate to and click on a picture to make it display fullscreen.You may notice that it automatically starts playing a slideshow if you have more than one picture in the same directory. You can click the play and pause buttons on the remote to toggle this behavior.To change the slideshow speed, orientation, and transition effects, click the options dropdown in the top right of the file explorer. There you can see the many options available to be changed.The TVs have ~4.5 GB of space available for you to upload files to from your USB. To do this, follow these steps:Navigate to the options menu in the top right and select the Send option.Select all of the images you want to be stored onto the TV.When you are done selecting, click the Send button located in the top right and click Internal Memory from the dropdown. When a popup box appears, click Start.Once the process completes, you can navigate back to the internal memory through the dropdown in the top left and you will see all of the pictures you selected are now there.You can now remove the USB and play the images off of your TV.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Iribe/OfficeTV&oldid=8437"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/UMIACS:About has the title Section: None and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchUniversity of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer StudiesPlease see: https://www.umiacs.umd.edu (https://www.umiacs.umd.edu) Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=UMIACS:About&oldid=9528"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Iribe/ConferenceRooms/Zoom has the title Section: ConferenceRooms/Zoom and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from Iribe/ConferenceRooms/Zoom)Jump to navigationJump to searchSection: IntroductionBelow are steps outlining how to start a Zoom meeting. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk.Section: Logging into ZoomBefore starting a meeting, be sure to log into your account. Do this by following these steps:Using the conference room PC, log into the Conference user account. If the PC is already signed into the desktop, first sign out of the desktop and then sign in again to ensure a clean slate. This can happen if someone leaves the Conference Room PC without signing out. It will automatically sign out after 8 hours of inactivity. Please be sure to sign out when you are done.Using the Display on the Podium, tap the screen to turn it on.Under the Sources tab at the bottom, select *PC1* or *PC Main*. You will see the display at the opposite end of the room light up with the Windows login screen. Click the mouse, or press ENTER.Select the *Conference* account. This does not require a password. Subsequently, any changes you make on the account will not be saved. Click the search bar at the bottom left of the Desktop and type in 'Zoom'. You will see the Zoom Application in the search results. Press ENTER, or double click the Zoom Application. Once you are done, be sure to sign out of the session by right clicking the Windows button in the bottom left of the Desktop, hovering over 'Shut Down or Sign out', and clicking 'sign out'.Launch the Zoom application. You can either use the shortcut on the desktop or you can search for it in the search bar in the bottom left of the desktop.On the right side of the login window, click on 'Sign in with SSO', this will allow you to sign in with your UMD credentials. Type in 'umd' under company domain.  Click 'Continue'. This will cause a browser tab to automatically open up.In the browser, sign in to your UMD account with your credentials. Once you finish signing in on the browser, Zoom should automatically log you into your account. If not, click the big blue 'Launch Zoom' button.Section: Zoom MeetingsJoining an Existing MeetingTo join an existing meeting, click on 'Join' in the Zoom home page. A popup window will require a meeting ID (usually a 10-11 digit number) or a personal link. This should have been provided to you in advance by the host.Starting a New Zoom MeetingTo create a new meeting, click on 'New Meeting' in the Zoom home page.

These can be set in many ways but we will cover the most popular: tcsh and bash. You can see your PATH variable by using the built-in echo command in the shell.  When printing out environment variables you will need to prefix the variable with the $ sign.$ echo $PATH/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/binIn almost all cases you will want to append to either the beginning or end of your PATH variable and not replace it fully as this will most likely decrease the functionality of your shell.  For example, if you wanted to add the path /opt/UMtorque/bin to the end of your PATH then you could do the following,tcsh/cshsetenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/binbash/shexport PATH=${PATH}:/opt/UMtorque/binThese can be either typed into your shell directly or added to your shell's initialization files so every time you spawn a shell it will get this new PATH.Section: NoneTo modify the Windows PATH Environmental Variable do the following: Go to Control Panel and click on User Accounts. Then click on the User Accounts heading within User Accounts.On the left pane, click Change my environment variables.Under User Variables for <username> choose the PATH variable.If there is none, click New and put PATH for the Variable name.Click Edit and append the location you are trying to add. Different paths are separated by semicolons.To verify that the PATH variable has been modified properly do the following:Open a new Command Prompt (Start -> Accessories -> Command Prompt).Type in PATH.The updated PATH should be printed.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=EnvironmentalVariables&oldid=10331"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Windows_Patch_Management has the title Section: Windows Patch Management and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchIn order to combat the ever increasing number of 3rd party security vulnerabilities on Windows machines, UMIACS staff has deployed Ivanti Security and Compliance Manager. As security threats have evolved from the operating system to applications we have had to take this step in order to maintain operational security for the Institute. Currently the updates are focused on applications that are exposed to the internet such as web browsers, teleconferencing solutions, Adobe Flash, Java, etc.Ivanti is currently deployed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as  Enterprise supported Windows laptops and home machines.Section: Automated ScanningPatches are deployed during the week leading up to the maintenance window. Specifically, they will always be released on the Wednesday that falls between the 9th and the 15th of every month, and typically in the morning.Desktops will scan for updates to be installed every night sometime between 7pm and 9pm. If you are not logged in during those times, the system will automatically install the patches and reboot if necessary. If you remain active on your system during those times, you will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.Laptops will scan for updates to be installed at least once every day (assuming the laptop is powered on). This will only occur when the laptop has an active Internet connection (wired or wireless). You will see a popup with the scan beginning and (once patches are downloaded) a prompt from Ivanti asking to begin installing patches.Installation can be deferred until lock/logoff if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, installation will automatically proceed:Desktops: 24 hoursLaptops: 3 hoursIf a reboot is required after installation finishes, you will receive another pop up. It is highly suggested to reboot right away due to system instability and vulnerability. However, reboot can be deferred for up to 6 days if desired. If you do not respond to the prompt within a given amount of time, the machine will automatically reboot:Desktops: 24 hoursLaptops: 9 hoursIf you interrupt the installation process between when the first patch begins installing and when the last patch finishes installing, Ivanti may ask to reboot before continuing to install the remaining patches next time it pops up. This is by design. If you would like to avoid multiple reboots on a machine that is used intermittently (such as a laptop), we would recommend starting a manual scan just before you stop using the machine for the night and then letting the machine download and apply all patches overnight. See below section for how to do this.Section: Manual ScanningThis should only need to be done on laptops or home machines in the event that Ivanti has not had a large enough time window to scan your computer recently, but can be optionally done if you see fit. Please note you will need an active Internet connection for this to work, however you do not need to be on the UMIACS VPN.Search for "Security Scan" from the Start menu and click the result that shows up (should show a shield icon). The scan will begin. Patches will be detected and downloaded.Note: The scan may fail on the "Checking for other running scanners" step if Ivanti is already running an invisible scan in the background. If this occurs, wait 10-15 minutes and then retry the scan.After all patches have been downloaded, you will be prompted to allow the install to begin.After all patches have been installed, you may be prompted to reboot.If you do not want to reboot immediately, you can click on the 'Remind me in:' drop down menu and click 'More options...'Click the 'Remind me on' radio button and choose a date and time before the deadline (it will tell you what the deadline is). Then click 'Remind me later'.After reboot, run another scan and verify no patches are detected. If a patch is continually failing, please  contact staff.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Windows_Patch_Management&oldid=10994"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Main_Page has the title Section: Main Page and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: AnnouncementsPlease see our intranet (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu)  page for announcements.Section: Technical Reference Getting StartedBroad introduction to UMIACS Accounts and services.

After you are connected, follow the instructions for adding a printer queue below. Please note that you must be on the VPN whenever you print.Section: Pre-Installation Knowledge on Printing at UMIACS Printer Queue NamingSection: Installation of printer queuePlease note that this applies to machines on any UMIACS network. This includes all proxy networks, the vast majority of machines in the labs, and machines connected to the UMIACS VPN - but not a wireless network (e.g., eduroam, umd-guest) alone. Go to Start and search "\\printers.ad.umiacs.umd.edu" in the search box.You will be prompted with a box for authentication if you are not signed into Windows with your UMIACS account (e.g. on a laptop or self-supported machine).  Make sure to prefix 'UMIACS\' to your username.  (For example, if your username was 'johndoe' you would enter 'UMIACS\johndoe' in the username box.)Check the box for 'Remember my credentials' before clicking OK or you may not be able to add printer queues in the next step.A list of printer queues will appear.  Select your desired printer by double clicking on the queue.Wait for the printer driver installation.  This may take a minute or two to complete.Once done, you can start using the printer.Section: TroubleshootingIf you receive the following error when attempting to add a printer queue, the issue may be that your computer is configured for a higher level of printer security than is default at UMIACS as a result of the PrintNightmare vulnerability (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrintNightmare) .To resolve this error:Click on the Start menu and type "cmd" in the run bar.Right-Click on the cmd button, and select "Run as Administrator" - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!Select "Yes" when it asks if you want to allow the following program to make changes.From the Command Prompt, run these commands in order:reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint" /v RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /freg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print" /v RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /fnet stop spooler /y && net start spoolerAttempt to add the printer queue again.Section: Removing a printer queueTo remove a printer queue, open the Start menu and search for and go to Control Panel. Next, click on "View devices and printers." To remove the queue, right click on the printer and select "Remove device". If you wish to add the printer back, follow the instructions above.Section: Duplex PrintingMany printers in UMIACS support duplex (2 sided) printing. To make the duplex printing default, first make sure the appropriate printer queue is installed via the directions above. Afterwards, go to start, then “Devices and Printers.”Once the printer has been installed proceed by right clicking on the queue then selecting “Printing preferences.”After a few seconds the following menu will come up. Make sure you are on the “Printing Shortcuts” tab and select the “EcoSMART Settings” option then click on okay. This modification will allow you to print 2-sided whenever you choose to use this printer.Section: Store and Print PIN-Protected JobsPIN-protected jobs provide a way to ensure jobs are not printed until you are ready to pick them up. This can be useful if you have a sensitive job that you want to print on a public printer at UMIACS. Follow the below steps to store a job and then print it at the printer.Create a stored jobFrom the software program, select the Print option.Select the printer from the list of printers, and then select Properties or Preferences (name varies by software program)Click the Job Storage tab.Under Job Storage Mode, select Personal Job.In the drop-down menu under Make Job Private/Secure, select PIN to print, and type in a 4-digit number.Note: You will need to provide the entered PIN (4-digit number) at the printer's control panel.Click the OK button to close the Document Properties/Preferences dialog box. In the Print dialog box, click Print.Print a stored jobAfter you have created a stored job using the instructions above, follow these steps to print from the printer's control panel.From the Home screen on the printer control panel, select Print.Select Print from Job Storage.Select Choose, and then select the name of the folder where the job is stored.Select the name of the job, enter your chosen PIN (4-digit number), and click Ok.Select Print to print the job.Note: The print job is deleted from memory after it prints.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=WindowsPrinting&oldid=11726"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SLURM/JobSubmission has the title Section: SLURM/JobSubmission and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Job Submission1.1 srun1.1.1 Common srun Arguments1.1.2 Interactive Shell Sessions1.2 salloc1.3 sbatch1.3.1 Advanced Batch Scripts1.3.2 More Examples1.3.3 scancel2 Identifying Resources and Features2.1 show_nodes2.1.1 Examples2.2 show_available_nodes2.2.1 Footnotes2.2.2 Examples3 Requesting GPUs4 MPI exampleSection: Job SubmissionSLURM offers a variety of ways to run jobs. It is important to understand the different options available and how to request the resources required for a job in order for it to run successfully. All job submission should be done from submit nodes; any computational code should be run in a job allocation on compute nodes. The following commands outline how to allocate resources on the compute nodes and submit processes to be run on the allocated nodes.The cluster that everyone with a  UMIACS account has access to is Nexus. Please visit the Nexus page for instructions on how to connect to your assigned submit nodes.Computationally intensive processes run on submission nodes will be terminated. Please submit jobs to be scheduled on compute nodes for this purpose.For details on how SLURM decides how to schedule jobs when multiple jobs are waiting in a scheduler's queue, please see SLURM/Priority.Section: srunThe srun command is used to run a process on the compute nodes in the cluster. If you pass it a normal shell command (or command that executes a script), it will submit a job to run that shell command/script on a compute node and then return. srun accepts many command line options to specify the resources required by the command passed to it. Some common command line arguments are listed below and full documentation of all available options is available in the man page for srun, which can be accessed by running man srun.$ srun --qos=default --mem=100mb --time=1:00:00 bash -c 'echo "Hello World from" `hostname`'Hello World from tron33.umiacs.umd.eduIt is important to understand that srun is an interactive command. By default input to srun is broadcast to all compute nodes running your process and output from the compute nodes is redirected to srun. This behavior can be changed; however, srun will always wait for the command passed to finish before exiting, so if you start a long running process and end your terminal session, your process will stop running on the compute nodes and your job will end. To run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with  sbatch.Section: Common srun Arguments--job-name=<JOBNAME> Requests your job be named <JOBNAME>--mem=1g Requests 1GB of memory for your job, if no unit is given MB is assumed--ntasks=2 Requests 2 "tasks" which map to cores on a CPU for your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each core--nodes=2 Requests 2 nodes be allocated to your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each node--nodelist=<NODENAME> Requests to run your job on the <NODENAME> node--time=dd-hh:mm:ss Requests your job run for dd days, hh hours, mm minutes, and ss seconds--error=<ERRNAME> Redirects stderr for your job to the <ERRNAME> file--partition=<PARTITIONNAME> Requests your job run in the <PARTITIONNAME> partition--qos=<QOSNAME>default Requests your job run with the <QOSNAME> QOS, to see the available QOS options on a cluster, run show_qos--account=<ACCOUNTNAME> Requests your job runs under the <ACCOUNTNAME> Slurm account, different accounts have different available partitions/QOS--output=<OUTNAME> Redirects stdout for your job to the <OUTNAME> file--requeue Requests your job be automatically requeued if it is preempted--exclusive Requests your job be the only one running on the node(s) it is assigned to. This requires that your job be allocated all of the resources on the node(s). The scheduler does not automatically give your job all of the node's/nodes' resources, however, so if you need more than the default, you still need to request these with --ntasks and --memSection: Interactive Shell SessionsAn interactive shell session on a compute node can be useful for debugging or developing code that isn't ready to be run as a batch job. To get an interactive shell on a node, use srun with the --pty argument to invoke a shell:$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash$ hostnametron33.umiacs.umd.eduPlease do not leave interactive shells running for long periods of time when you are not working. This blocks resources from being used by everyone else.Section: sallocThe salloc command can also be used to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script. Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation. When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.$ salloc --qos=default -N 1 --mem=2g --time=01:00:00salloc: Granted job allocation 159$ srun /usr/bin/hostnametron33.umiacs.umd.edu$ exitexitsalloc: Relinquishing job allocation 159Please note that any commands not invoked with srun will be run locally on the submit node. Please be careful when using salloc.Section: sbatchThe sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes. To run a simple Hello World command on the compute nodes you could write a file, helloWorld.sh with the following contents:#!/bin/bashsrun bash -c 'echo Hello World from `hostname`'Then you need to submit the script with sbatch and request resources:$ sbatch --qos=default --mem=1g --time=1:00:00 helloWorld.shSubmitted batch job 121SLURM will return a job number that you can use to check the status of your job with squeue:$ squeue             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)               121      tron helloWor username  R       0:01      1 tron32Section: Advanced Batch ScriptsYou can also write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself. This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one "job step". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node. Since srun is blocks until the command finishes, we use the '&' operator to background the process so that both job steps can run at once; however, this means that we then need to use the wait command to block processing until all background processes have finished.#!/bin/bash# Lines that begin with #SBATCH specify commands to be used by SLURM for scheduling#SBATCH --job-name=helloWorld                                        # sets the job name#SBATCH --output=helloWorld.out.%j                                   # indicates a file to redirect STDOUT to; %j is the jobid.

identify further specific information about a node using  scontrol with various flags.There are also two command aliases developed by UMIACS staff to show various node information in aggregate. They are show_nodes and show_available_nodes.Section: show_nodesThe show_nodes command alias shows each node's name, number of CPUs, memory, {OS, CPU architecture, CPU type, GPU architecture (if the node has GPUs)} (as AVAIL_FEATURES), GRES (GPUs), and State. It essentially wraps the sinfo command with some pre-determined output format options and shows each node on its own line, in alphabetical order.To only view nodes in a specific partition, append -p <partition name> to the command alias.Section: Examples$ show_nodesNODELIST             CPUS       MEMORY     AVAIL_FEATURES                           GRES                             STATEbrigid16             48         512897     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7443               (null)                           idlebrigid17             48         512897     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7443               (null)                           idle...                  ...        ...        ...                                      ...                              ...vulcan45             32         513250     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7313,Ampere        gpu:rtxa6000:8                   idle(specific partition)$ show_nodes -p tronNODELIST             CPUS       MEMORY     AVAIL_FEATURES                           GRES                             STATEtron00               32         255233     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7302,Ampere        gpu:rtxa6000:8                   idletron01               32         255233     rhel8,x86_64,Zen,EPYC-7302,Ampere        gpu:rtxa6000:8                   idle...                  ...        ...        ...                                      ...                              ...tron69               32         383030     rhel8,x86_64,Xeon,4216,Turing            gpu:rtx2080ti:8                  idleSection: show_available_nodesThe show_available_nodes command alias takes zero or more arguments that correspond to Slurm constructs, resources, or features that you are looking to request a job with and tells you what nodes could theoretically[0,1] run a job with these arguments immediately. It assumes your job is a single-node job.These arguments are:--partition: Only include nodes in the specified partition(s).--account: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified account(s).--qos: Only include nodes from partitions that can use the specified QoS(es).--cpus: Only include nodes with at least this many CPUs free.--mem: Only include nodes with at least this much memory free. The default unit is MB if unspecified, but any of {K,M,G,T} can be suffixed to the number provided (will then be interpreted as KB, MB, GB, or TB, respectively).GRES-related arguments:--gres, --and-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains all of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings.--or-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains any of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gres if only one GRES type/quantity pairing is specified.GPU-related arguments:--gpus, --and-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains all of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings.--or-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains any of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gpus if only one GPU type/quantity pairing is specified.Feature-related arguments:--feature, --and-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains all of the specified feature(s).--or-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains any of the specified feature(s). Functionally identical to --and-feature if only one feature is specified.These arguments are also viewable by running show_available_nodes -h.If your passed argument set does not contain any resource-based arguments (CPUs/RAM/GRES or GPUs), a node is defined as available if it has at least 1 CPU and 1MB of RAM available.If there are no nodes available that meet your passed argument set, you will receive the message There are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.Section: Footnotes[0] - As of now, this command alias does not factor in resources occupied by jobs that could be preempted (based on the partition(s) passed to it, if present). This is soon to come.[1] - This command alias also does not factor in jobs with higher priority values requesting more resources, in the same partition(s), blocking execution of a job submitted with the arguments checked by the command alias. This is due to the complexity of calculating a job's priority value before it is actually submitted.Section: ExamplesShow all available nodes:$ show_available_nodesbrigid17  cpus=16,mem=414593Mbrigid18  cpus=8,mem=24875M...Show nodes available in the tron partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition trontron00  cpus=14,mem=50433M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:1tron01  cpus=10,mem=17665M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:2...Show nodes with one or more RTX A5000 or RTX A6000 GPUs available to the vulcan account:$ show_available_nodes --account vulcan --or-gpus rtxa5000:1,rtxa6000:1vulcan32  cpus=16,mem=193778M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:4vulcan33  cpus=15,mem=181499M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:3...Show nodes with 4 or more CPUs, 48G or more memory, and one or more RTX A6000 GPUs available in the scavenger partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --cpus=4 --mem=48g --or-gpus=rtxa6000:1cbcb27  cpus=59,mem=218303M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:6clip06  cpus=20,mem=93448M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:1...Show nodes with Turing (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/turing)  or Ampere (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture)  architecture GPUs available in the scavenger partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --or-feature=Ampere,Turingcbcb25  cpus=24,mem=255278M,gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:1,gpu:gtx1080ti:1cbcb26  cpus=127,mem=447707M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:7...Show nodes with Zen (https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/zen-core)  architecture CPUs and Ampere (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture)  architecture GPUs available in the scavenger partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --and-feature=Zen,Amperecbcb26  cpus=127,mem=447707M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:7cbcb27  cpus=59,mem=218303M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:6...(bogus example) Attempt to show nodes available in the bogus partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=bogusThere are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.Section: Requesting GPUsIf you need to do processing on a GPU, you will need to request that your job have access to GPUs just as you need to request processors or CPU cores. In SLURM, GPUs are considered "generic resources" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:#. If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec'd GPU.Note that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs.$ srun --pty --qos=medium --gres=gpu:2 nvidia-smi...Wed Mar  6 16:59:39 2024+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     ||-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

This provides a way to ensure security updates are installed and activated on the numerous different platforms and appliances that we maintain.The window for each month is calculated by adding 9 days to Microsoft's Patch Tuesday (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday)  to allow us to marshal patches released that month from Microsoft, Red Hat, Apple, and other OS and application vendors and have enough time to get our systems prepared to reboot.  This translates to the window being on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month.  The window lasts from 5pm-8pm.Nexus will always have a reservation in place from 4:45pm-8pm on the day of the upcoming window to prevent jobs from being scheduled on compute nodes for the entirety of said window as well as 15 minutes before, to allow jobs to fully end. Any job submitted before the reservation begins that has a time limit that would run into the reservation will be held until at least the end of the reservation (8pm on the day of the window). This is to prevent issues with jobs failing to end properly causing delays in work we have scheduled during the window.A list of upcoming maintenance windows is as follows, with the next one in bold. Again, the window is on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month, and lasts from 5pm-8pm.October 17th 2024November 21st 2024December 19th 2024Section: ArchivesJanuary 17th 2013 - BEGIN time of 8pm-12am for this window through February 20th 2020February 21st 2013March 21st 2013April 18th 2013May 23rd 2013June 20th 2013July 18th 2013August 22nd 2013September 19th 2013October 17th 2013December 19th 2013January 23rd 2014February 20th 2014March 20th 2014April 17th 2014May 22nd 2014June 19th 2014July 17th 2014August 21st 2014September 18th 2014October 23rd 2014November 20th 2014December 18th 2014January 22nd 2015February 19th 2015March 19th 2015May 21st 2015June 18th 2015July 23rd 2015August 20th 2015September 17th 2015October 22nd 2015November 19th 2015December 17th 2015January 21st 2016February 18th 2016March 12th 2016 (Adjusted date for AVW power outage)April 21st 2016May 19th 2016June 23rd 2016July 21st 2016August 18th 2016September 22nd 2016October 20th 2016November 17th 2016December 22nd 2016January 19th 2017February 23rd 2017March 23rd 2017April 20th 2017May 18th 2017June 22nd 2017July 20th 2017August 17th 2017September 21st 2017October 19th 2017December 21st 2017January 18th 2018February 22nd 2018March 22nd 2018April 19th 2018May 17th 2018June 21st 2018July 19th 2018August 23rd 2018September 20th 2018October 18th 2018December 20th 2018January 24th 2019February 21st 2019April 18th 2019May 23rd 2019June 20th 2019July 18th 2019August 22nd 2019September 19th 2019October 17th 2019November 21st 2019December 19th 2019January 23rd 2020February 20th 2020April 23rd 2020 - BEGIN time of 5pm-7pm for this window through August 19th 2021June 18th 2020July 23rd 2020August 20th 2020September 17th 2020October 22nd 2020November 19th 2020December 17th 2020January 21st 2021February 18th 2021March 25th 2021 (Adjusted date for extended Spring Break)April 22nd 2021May 20th 2021June 17th 2021July 22nd 2021August 19th 2021September 23rd 2021 - BEGIN time of 5-8pm for this window and all others belowOctober 21st 2021November 18th 2021January 20th 2022February 17th 2022March 24th 2022 (Adjusted date for Spring Break)April 21st 2022May 19th 2022June 23rd 2022July 21st 2022August 18th 2022September 22nd 2022October 20th 2022November 17th 2022January 19th 2023February 23rd 2023April 20th 2023May 18th 2023June 22nd 2023July 20th 2023August 17th 2023September 21st 2023October 19th 2023December 20th 2023 (Adjusted date for early Winter Break)January 18th 2024February 22nd 2024March 21st 2024April 18th 2024May 23th 2024June 20th 2024July 18th 2024August 22nd 2024September 19th 2024Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MonthlyMaintenanceWindow&oldid=12049"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/PerlLocalLib has the title Section: PerlLocalLib and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchPlease see complete documentation at http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm (http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm) .To get started you will just need to know that everything by default will be installed into your ~/perl5 directory.

It provides three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive or non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.Section: Documentation Submitting Jobs Checking Job Status Checking Cluster Status Understanding Job Priority Job Preemption OverviewOfficial Documentation (http://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) FAQ (http://slurm.schedmd.com/faq.html) Related documentation: Using VS CodeSection: CommandsBelow are some of the common commands used in SLURM. Further information on how to use these commands is found in the documentation linked above. To see all flags available for a command, please check the command's manual by using man <COMMAND> on the command line.Section: srun (https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html) srun runs a parallel job on a cluster managed by SLURM.  If necessary, it will first create a resource allocation in which to run the parallel job.Section: salloc (https://slurm.schedmd.com/salloc.html) salloc allocates a SLURM job allocation, which is a set of resources (nodes), possibly with some set of constraints (e.g. number of processors per node).  When salloc successfully obtains the requested allocation, it then runs the command specified by the user.  Finally, when the user specified command is complete, salloc relinquishes the job allocation.  If no command is specified, salloc runs the user's default shell.Section: sbatch (https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) sbatch submits a batch script to SLURM.  The batch script may be given to sbatch through a file name on the command line, or if no file name is specified, sbatch will read in a script from standard input.  The batch script may contain options preceded with #SBATCH before any executable commands in the script.Section: squeue (https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html) squeue views job and job step information for jobs managed by SLURM.Section: scancel (https://slurm.schedmd.com/scancel.html) scancel signals or cancels jobs, job arrays, or job steps.  An arbitrary number of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a space separated list of specific job and/or job step IDs.Section: sacct (https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html) sacct displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log file or SLURM database in a variety of forms for your analysis.  The sacct command displays information on jobs, job steps, status, and exitcodes by default.  You can tailor the output with the use of the --format= option to specify the fields to be shown.Section: sstat (https://slurm.schedmd.com/sstat.html) sstat displays job status information for your analysis.  The sstat command displays information pertaining to CPU, Task, Node, Resident Set Size (RSS) and Virtual Memory (VM).  You can tailor the output with the use of the --fields= option to specify the fields to be shown.Section: ModulesIf you are trying to use  GNU Modules in a Slurm job, please read the section of our Modules documentation on  non-interactive shell sessions.  This also needs to be done if the OS version of the compute node you are scheduled on is different from the OS version of the submission node you are submitting the job from.Section: Running Jupyter Notebook on a Compute NodeThe steps to run a Jupyter Notebook from a compute node are listed below.Section: Setting up your Python Virtual Environment Create a Python virtual environment on the compute node you are assigned and  activate it. Next, install Jupyter using pip by following the steps here (https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#alternative-for-experienced-python-users-installing-jupyter-with-pip) . You may also use other environment management systems such as Conda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)  if desired.Section: Running Jupyter NotebookAfter you've set up the Python virtual environment, submit a job, activate the environment within the job, and run the following command on the compute node you are assigned:jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 --ip=0.0.0.0This will start running the notebook on port 8889. Note: You must keep this shell window open to be able to connect. If the submission node for the cluster you are using is not accessible via the public internet, you must also be on a machine connected to the UMIACS network or connected to our  VPN in order to access the Jupyter notebook once you start the SSH tunnel, so ensure this is the case before starting the tunnel. Then, on your local machine, runssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:<NODENAME>:8889 <USERNAME>@<SUBMISSIONNODE>.umiacs.umd.eduThis will tunnel port 8889 from the compute node to port 8888 on your local machine, using <SUBMISSIONNODE> as an intermediate node. Make sure to replace <USERNAME> with your username, <SUBMISSIONNODE> with the name of the submission node you want to use, and <NODENAME> with the name of the compute node you are assigned. Note that this command will not display any output if the connection is successful due to the included ssh flags. You must also keep this shell window open to be able to connect.For example, assuming your username is username and that you are using the Nexus cluster, have been  assigned the nexusgroup submission nodes, and are assigned compute node tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:tron00.umiacs.umd.edu:8889 username@nexusgroup.umiacs.umd.eduYou can then open a web browser and type in localhost:8888 to access the notebook.Notes:Later versions of Jupyter have token authentication enabled by default - you will need to prepend the /?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX part of the URL provided by the terminal output after starting the notebook in order to connect if this is the case. e.g. localhost:8888/?token=fcc6bd0f996e7aa89376c33cb34f7b80890502aacc97d98eIf the port on the compute node mentioned in the example above (8889) is not working, it may be that someone else has already started a process (Jupyter notebook or otherwise) using that specific port number on that specific compute node. The port number can be replaced with any other ephemeral port (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port)  number you'd like, just make sure to change it in both the command you run on the compute node and the ssh command from your local machine.Section: NonePBS/TORQUE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORQUE)  was the previous workload manager and job submission framework used at UMIACS prior to SLURM's adoption.

It provides a unified password space in which we can manage strong passwords easily and it can prevent your password from being sent across the network as cleartext.Section: Working with KerberosWhen you successfully log into any of our Kerberos authenticated systems, you will be granted a set of credentials which will identify you to other network resources. Most users can take advantage of Kerberos without any detailed knowledge about the system.The only significant complication for some users is that credentials expire after one week at UMIACS. In some environments, the lack of credentials can cause the user environment to behave erratically as network resources become unavailable.Whenever possible, we strongly suggest that users log out of their environments nightly.Section: Listing your credentialsIt is often useful to examine your current credentials. Using klist, you can verify that your login is correct, -bash-4.2$  klist Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg Default principal: username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU  Valid starting     Expires            Service principal 05/28/18 11:39:36  05/28/18 18:19:36  krbtgt/AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU'Default principal' indicates the Kerberos identity of the current process. In this case, the Kerberos principal, 'username@AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU' indicates that we are authenticated as the user 'username' to the realm 'AD.UMIACS.UMD.EDU'.If your credentials have not been set up correctly, klist will report: -bash-4.2$  klist klist: No credentials cache found (ticket cache FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_2174_dcDWCg)Section: Single Sign On ServicesKerberos authenticated IMAP and SMTP provide secure and convenient methods for sending and reading mail. Unlike traditional IMAP and SMTP services, your password is never sent over the network as cleartext and your password is not cached on a client.Section: Password SecurityKerberos security depends on the security of your password. Although Kerberos can make secure access to services convenient, it is still your responsibility to secure your password. Please try to choose a strong password and use secure protocols.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Kerberos&oldid=10385"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Special:SpecialPages has the title Section: Special pages and contains the following info: Jump to navigationJump to searchSection: Maintenance reportsBroken redirectsDead-end pagesDouble redirectsLong pagesOldest pagesOrphaned pagesPages with the fewest revisionsPages without language linksProtected pagesProtected titlesShort pagesUncategorized categoriesUncategorized filesUncategorized pagesUncategorized templatesUnused categoriesUnused filesUnused templatesWanted categoriesWanted filesWanted pagesWanted templatesSection: Lists of pagesAll pagesAll pages with prefixCategoriesExternal links searchList of redirectsPages with a page propertySearchTracking categoriesSection: NoneLog inSection: Users and rightsActive users listAutoblocksBlocked usersBot passwordsGrantsLink accountsPassword policiesPreferencesReset tokensUnlink accountsUser contributionsUser group rightsUser listUser rightsSection: Recent changes and logsGallery of new filesLogsNew pagesRecent changesRelated changesValid change tagsWatchlistSection: Media reports and uploadsFile listList of files with duplicatesMIME searchMedia statisticsSearch for duplicate filesSection: Data and toolsAPI sandboxBook sourcesContribution scoresExpand templatesStatisticsSystem messagesVersionSection: Redirecting special pagesDelete a pageDifferencesEdit a pageNew sectionPage historyPage infoPermanent linkProtect a pagePurgeRandom pageRandom page in categoryRandom redirectRandom root pageRedirect by file, user, page, revision, or log IDSection: High use pagesMost linked-to categoriesMost linked-to filesMost linked-to pagesMost transcluded pagesPages with the most categoriesPages with the most interwikisPages with the most revisionsSection: Page toolsCompare pagesExport pagesGet dataWhat links hereRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Special:SpecialPages"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Iribe/ConferenceRooms/View has the title Section: Iribe/ConferenceRooms/View and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThis page will show you how to view room schedules through Google Calendar.Section: StepsNavigate to https://calendar.google.com (https://calendar.google.com) .

This mode has no effect for files that are not executable.  To a lesser extent than SetUID this can lead to security issues when the group in question has some files that would be allowed to be read or written when otherwise not permitted.  There are very limited uses for this feature these days and its use is discouraged.Section: SetGID DirectoriesSetGID directories have a much more benign behavior.  When this bit is set on a directory all filesystem creations underneath that directory will inherit the group from the directory.  UMIACS policy is to keep users' default UID and GID.  So for users who wish to have certain directory trees have consistent groups the use of SetGID directories is useful.  The SetGID directory bit will force all files created under that directory to have the same GID.  Any directories created will also be given the same GID and the SetGID bit so that the same policy is applied at the next level of directory down.Before we give an example of how to use the sticky bit please see the documentation about umask.  SetGID will only work on the GID and the setting a sticky bit and will not change any other permissions.  By default the umask is 022 and is a bit too restrictive for the use of SetGID effectively.  (002 or 007 will be the appropriate setting depending if you want Others to be able to read/execute or not)First an example of what our default group is and what other groups we belong to:[username@novelty ~/staff]$ iduid=9001(username) gid=29001(username) groups=15114(umadmin),29001(username)Now we have created a directory called staff that we want to share with the umadmin group (which is not my default group)[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .drwxr-xr-x  2 username username   96 Jun 16 11:34 .We are going to set the new group to umadmin and set rwxrwxr-x permissions.  Then finally we will add the SetGID bit.[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chgrp umadmin .[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod 775 .[username@novelty ~/staff]$ chmod g+s .Now you can see we have a directory that is correctly set up,[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -la .drwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 11:34 .We are going to use umask of 002 since we want to allow others to read the files.We are going to now create a test file and test directory,[username@novelty ~/staff]$ touch test[username@novelty ~/staff]$ mkdir testdirNow as you can see we have the correct groups and permissions being used to create both files directories,[username@novelty ~/staff]$ ls -ladrwxrwsr-x  3 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 .-rw-rw-r--  1 username umadmin    0 Jun 16 12:58 testdrwxrwsr-x  2 username umadmin   96 Jun 16 12:58 testdirRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SetGID&oldid=9837"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Services/Compute/HPC has the title Section: Services/Compute/HPC and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchUMIACS provides integration and maintenance of High Performance Computational (HPC) clusters.HPC systems at UMIACS are current built on top of RHEL 7 and SLURM.

You can change this to make messages available to the public or turn off archiving entirely. Archives are not searchable.Section: General SettingsMost of the defaults for lists are probably fine but a number of them bear special mention. Options under Subscribing under "Privacy options":By default, no one can see the list.If this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the first item "Advertise this list when people ask what lists are on this machine?" from NO to YES, and then "Submit Your Changes" on the bottom of the page. Note that even if users can't see the list, they can still subscribe (or try to subscribe). They simply need to know the URL.By default, anyone can subscribe to the list. (To ensure that someone can't subscribe someone else as a prank, Mailman sends a confirm email message to the users asking something like, "You have been subscribed to.... Are you sure you want to subscribe? Just REPLYing to this message will subscribe you").If this is not the behavior you want, change the setting on the second item "What steps are required for subscription?" and click "Require approval" or "Confirm and approve" and then "Submit Your Changes" on the bottom of the page. Approval means that you, as the list administrator, will get a message saying USER@HOST wants to subscribe. You can then approve or discard their request.Option under Membership exposure under "Privacy options":By default, only list members can see the email addresses of other list members. Users can hide their own addresses from their list subscription page. Likewise, you can hide some users and not others from the "Membership Management" page.If you want to broadly change visibility for all users, change the setting on the first item "Who can view subscription list?" and click either "Anyone" or "List admin only" and then "Submit Your Changes" on the bottom of the page.Section: Moderated ListsSection: SetupIf you want your list to be moderated (i.e. ONLY you and/or a few others can post to it), this can be set at the bottom of the "Membership Management" --> "Membership List" page. Make sure to also set this for all new members under "Privacy options" --> "Sender filters". If moderation is set, make sure the list admin (and/or whomever you want to be able to send to the list) has their moderation bit turned off.List admins can add moderators to a list by entering their email addresses in the "The list moderator email addresses. Multiple moderator addresses, each on separate line is okay." box on the "General Options" page of the list's admin interface:As soon as the first moderator is added to the list, a list admin should set the moderator password and communicate it to the initial moderator(s). This password can only be changed by a list admin. It does not give full administrative access to the list.Section: For list moderatorsModerators and administrators will receive an email similar to the following if a message is being held for moderation:The provided URL can also be visited at any time to view the queue of messages pending moderation:  http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admindb/LISTNAME (http://lists.umiacs.umd.edu/mailman/admindb/LISTNAME) From here, if there are one or more messages pending moderation, you will see a summary of the messages broken down per-sender. Please note that the addresses in these screenshots are hidden for privacy, but will appear on the actual moderation page.There are two ways messages from senders may appear on this interface, depending on whether or not the sender is a member of the list:If the sender is a member of the list (but their moderation bit is on):If the sender is not a member of the list:From these windows, you can choose an action (Defer, Accept, Reject, Discard) for all messages from a specific sender via the radio buttons in the left sub-window, or handle individual messages by clicking on the [#] hyperlinks next to each subject line.The key difference between the two categories of held messages (from a moderated member vs. from a non-member) is how you can handle future messages from the respective senders in the future:For moderated members, you can choose the "Clear this member's moderate flag" option in the window for that member to automatically allow future messages from them to the list.For non-members, you can choose to either add the sender's email address to one of the automatic filters for non-members (Accept, Hold, Reject, or Discard) to automatically action their messages in the future. There is also an option to ban the sender's email address from subscribing to the list if you see fit.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MailmanListAdmin&oldid=8927"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/LinuxFAQ has the title Section: LinuxFAQ and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchHow do I use umasks and SetGID bits for group control under UNIX?How do I add a path to my Shell in UNIX?How do I  transfer a file or data?Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=LinuxFAQ&oldid=9864"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/UMIACS:General_disclaimer has the title Section: None and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThere is currently no text in this page.You can search for this page title in other pages, or search the related logs, but you do not have permission to create this page.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/UMIACS:General_disclaimer"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Ubuntu/SoftwareCenter has the title Section: Ubuntu/SoftwareCenter and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThe Ubuntu Software Center provides a mechanism to install many different applications and libraries to your Ubuntu desktop without requiring 'su' or 'sudo' (administrative) access.

If you would like to set up specific Google Drive or Dropbox remotes, you can go directly to the section labeled "Google Drive" or "Dropbox".Section: Contents1 Remote Setup on A Headless System1.1 Rclone configuration file1.2 Rclone authorize2 Google Drive2.1 Common Use2.2 Creating a cronjob3 DropboxSection: Remote Setup on A Headless SystemTo remote setup rclone, you will first have to SSH into one of UMIACS' hosts and load the rclone module by typing module load rclone. If this does not work, check that the rclone module is available by running the command module avail rclone. If the module is not available, SSH to a host where it is.If you are instead installing rclone on a system that you have administrative privileges on, downloads are available at https://rclone.org/downloads/ (https://rclone.org/downloads/) .Once you have loaded the module or installed the software, there are two ways to remote configure rclone. The first is by copying the rclone config file, and the second is by using rclone authorize.Section: Rclone configuration fileTo copy the rclone config file, first configure rclone on your desktop machine. This can be achieved by running the command rclone config to set up the file and then finding the location of the configuration file using the command rclone config file, which should yield output similar to what is below:$ rclone config fileConfiguration file is stored at:/home/user/.rclone.confThis file can then be transferred to the remote box using scp, copy/paste, ftp, sftp, etc. The command rclone config file can also be run on the remote box to find the correct location to which the file should be moved.Section: Rclone authorizeTo configure using rclone authorize instead, run the command Remote config on your headless machine, and then select the option for working on a headless machine by answering the first prompt with an n. The resulting output should look like this:Remote configUse auto config? * Say Y if not sure * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machiney) Yesn) Noy/n> nFor this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.Execute the following on your machine:	rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"Then paste the result below:result>Next, on your main desktop machine, run the command rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive". Follow the link that the output directs you to; you should now have received a secret token on your desktop machine console, in a message similar to the one below:rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/authLog in and authorize rclone for accessWaiting for code...Got codePaste the following into your remote machine --->SECRET_TOKEN<---End pasteGo back to your headless machine and paste the secret message on the console where it says result>. Finally, approve the token by answering the prompts that follow:result> SECRET_TOKEN--------------------[acd12]client_id = client_secret = token = SECRET_TOKEN--------------------y) Yes this is OKe) Edit this remoted) Delete this remotey/e/d>If there are any issues with the remote setup, visit https://rclone.org/remote_setup/ (https://rclone.org/remote_setup/)  for more information.Section: Google DriveIn order to sync files to Google Drive on Linux systems, use of the command line program Rclone is necessary. The first step is to SSH into one of UMIACS' hosts with X11 forwarding enabled (use the -XY flag) or (if the host is a workstation) log in over GUI and launch the terminal. If Rclone is already in the module tree, then load the Rclone module using:module load rcloneIf the module is NOT installed on the machine, install it from here: https://rclone.org/downloads/ (https://rclone.org/downloads/) Once installed, load into it using the previous command.To make a new remote, run the command rclone config. This should produce output similar to what is below:n) New remoter) Rename remotec) Copy remotes) Set configuration passwordq) Quit confign/r/c/s/q> Choose to make a new remote, and give it a name. There should then be prompt asking for the type of storage to configure. Input drive for Google Drive.Type of storage to configure.Enter a string value.

If this is not the case, please do so before proceeding with the Dropbox remote setup.First, make a new remote by running the command rclone config. This should produce output similar to what is below:n) New remoter) Rename remotec) Copy remotes) Set configuration passwordq) Quit confign/r/c/s/q> Choose to make a new remote, and give it a name. The setup will then prompt you to choose a type of storage to configure. You can either choose the number from the options that corresponds to "Dropbox", or simply type in dropbox. When prompted for your Dropbox App Key and Secret, it is okay to leave those blank. The console will then redirect you to a browser page that will prompt you to enter a code displayed on the console and authorize rclone for access. Once you have followed the instructions on the webpage, the console will display your credentials and ask for approval to confirm the remote.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Rclone&oldid=11684"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/ApplicationResource has the title Section: SecGroups and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from ApplicationResource)Jump to navigationJump to searchSecurity Groups are authentication groups that control access to various applications in UMIACS.

The resource manager for Nexus is SLURM.  Resources are arranged into partitions where users are able to schedule computational jobs.  Users are arranged into a number of SLURM accounts based on faculty, lab, or center investments.Section: Contents1 Getting Started1.1 Access1.2 Jobs1.2.1 Interactive1.2.2 Batch2 Partitions3 Quality of Service (QoS)3.1 Job QoS3.2 Partition QoS4 Storage4.1 Home Directories4.2 Scratch Directories4.2.1 Network Scratch Directories4.2.2 Local Scratch Directories4.3 Faculty Allocations4.4 Project Allocations4.5 DatasetsSection: Getting StartedAll accounts in UMIACS are sponsored.  If you don't already have a UMIACS account, please see Accounts for information on getting one.  You need a full UMIACS account (not a  collaborator account) in order to access Nexus.Section: AccessYour access to submission nodes (alternatively called login nodes) for Nexus computational resources is determined by your account sponsor's department, center, or lab affiliation.  You can log into the UMIACS Directory CR application (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/cr/)  and select the Computational Resource (CR) in the list that has the prefix nexus.  The Hosts section lists your available submission nodes - generally a pair of nodes of the format nexus<department, lab, or center abbreviation>[00,01], e.g., nexusgroup00 and nexusgroup01.Note - UMIACS requires multi-factor authentication through our Duo instance.  This is completely discrete from both UMD's and CSD's Duo instances.  You will need to enroll one or more devices to access resources in UMIACS, and will be prompted to enroll when you log into the Directory application for the first time.Once you have identified your submission nodes, you can SSH directly into them.  From there, you are able to submit to the cluster via our SLURM workload manager.  You need to make sure that your submitted jobs have the correct account, partition, and qos.Section: JobsSLURM jobs are  submitted by either srun or sbatch depending if you are doing an interactive job or batch job, respectively.  You need to provide the where/how/who to run the job and specify the resources you need to run with.For the who/where/how, you may be required to specify --account, --partition, and/or --qos (respectively) to be able to adequately submit jobs to the Nexus.For resources, you may need to specify --time for time, --ntasks for CPUs, --mem for RAM, and --gres=gpu for GPUs in your submission arguments to meet your requirements.  There are defaults for all four, so if you don't specify something, you may be scheduled with a very minimal set of time and resources (e.g., by default, NO GPUs are included if you do not specify --gres=gpu).  For more information about submission flags for GPU resources, see  here.  You can also can run man srun on your submission node for a complete list of available submission arguments.For a list of available GPU types on Nexus and their specs, please see Nexus/GPUs.Section: InteractiveOnce logged into a submission node, you can run simple interactive jobs.  If your session is interrupted from the submission node, the job will be killed.  As such, we encourage use of a terminal multiplexer such as Tmux.$ srun --pty --ntasks=4 --mem=2gb --gres=gpu:1 nvidia-smi -LGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-ae5dc1f5-c266-5b9f-58d5-7976e62b3ca1)Section: BatchBatch jobs are scheduled with a script file with an optional ability to embed job scheduling parameters via variables that are defined by #SBATCH lines at the top of the file.  You can find some examples in our SLURM/JobSubmission documentation.Section: PartitionsThe SLURM resource manager uses partitions to act as job queues which can restrict size, time and user limits.  The Nexus has a number of different partitions of resources.  Different Centers, Labs, and Faculty are able to invest in computational resources that are restricted to approved users through these partitions.Partitions usable by all non-class account users:Nexus/Tron - Pool of resources available to all UMIACS and CSD faculty and graduate students.Scavenger - Preemption (https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html)  partition that supports nodes from multiple other partitions.  More resources are available to schedule simultaneously than in other partitions, however jobs are subject to preemption rules.  You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.  The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again. For an overview of things you can check within scripts to determine if your job was preempted/resumed, see SLURM/Preemption.Partitions usable by ClassAccounts: Class - Pool available for UMIACS class accounts sponsored by either UMIACS or CSD faculty.Partitions usable by specific lab/center users:Nexus/CBCB - CBCB lab pool available for CBCB lab members.Nexus/CLIP - CLIP lab pool available for CLIP lab members.Nexus/CML - CML lab pool available for CML lab members.Nexus/GAMMA - GAMMA lab pool available for GAMMA lab members.Nexus/MBRC - MBRC lab pool available for MBRC lab members.Nexus/MC2 - MC2 lab pool available for MC2 lab members.Nexus/Vulcan - Vulcan lab pool available for Vulcan lab members.Section: NoneSLURM uses Quality of Service (QoS) both to provide limits on job sizes (termed by us as "job QoS") as well as to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user or per group (termed by us as "partition QoS").Section: Job QoSJob QoS are used to provide limits on the size of job that you can run. You should try to allocate only the resources your job actually needs, as resources that each of your jobs schedules are counted against your  fair-share priority in the future.default - Default job QoS. Limited to 4 CPU cores, 1 GPU, and 32GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 3 days.medium - Limited to 8 CPU cores, 2 GPUs, and 64GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 2 days.high - Limited to 16 CPU cores, 4 GPUs, and 128GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 1 day.scavenger - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is both only available in the scavenger partition and the only job QoS available in the scavenger partition. To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.  Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.You can display these job QoS from the command line using the show_qos command.  By default, the command will only show job QoS that you can access.  The above four job QoS are the ones that everyone can access.$ show_qos                Name     MaxWall                        MaxTRES MaxJobsPU                      MaxTRESPU -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------- ------------------------------              default  3-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G                                                          high  1-00:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G                                                                                      medium  2-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G                                                     scavenger  3-00:00:00                                           cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G If you want to see all job QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_qos --all command. $ show_qos --all                Name     MaxWall                        MaxTRES MaxJobsPU                      MaxTRESPU -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------- ------------------------------              cml-cpu  7-00:00:00                                        8                                         cml-default  7-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G         2                                            cml-high  1-12:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G         2                                       cml-high_long 14-00:00:00              cpu=32,gres/gpu=8         8                     gres/gpu=8           cml-medium  3-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G         2                                       cml-scavenger  3-00:00:00                                                             gres/gpu=24        cml-very_high  1-12:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G         8                    gres/gpu=12              default  3-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G                                                          high  1-00:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G                                                       highmem 21-00:00:00                  cpu=32,mem=2T                                                     huge-long 10-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G                                                        medium  2-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G                                                     scavenger  3-00:00:00                                           cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G           vulcan-cpu  2-00:00:00                cpu=1024,mem=4T         4                                      vulcan-default  7-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G         2                                       vulcan-exempt  7-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G         2                                         vulcan-high  1-12:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G         2                                        vulcan-janus  3-00:00:00    cpu=32,gres/gpu=10,mem=256G                                                 vulcan-medium  3-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G         2                                       vulcan-sailon  3-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G                              gres/gpu=48     vulcan-scavenger  3-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G                                          To find out what accounts and partitions you have access to, first use the show_assoc command to show your account/job QoS combinations. Then, use the scontrol show partition command and note the AllowAccounts entry for each listed partition. You are able to submit to any partition that allows an account that you have. If you need to use an account other than the default account nexus, you will need to specify it via the --account submission argument.Section: Partition QoSPartition QoS are used to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user (MaxTRESPU) or per group (GrpTRES).To view partition QoS, use the show_partition_qos command.$ show_partition_qos                Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------------------            scavenger         500  cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G                                      tron         500     cpu=32,gres/gpu=4,mem=256G                      If you want to see all partition QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_partition_qos --all command. $ show_partition_qos --all                Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------------------                 Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES-------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------------------                cbcb         500                                 cpu=1260,mem=50016G           cbcb-heng         500               class         500     cpu=32,gres/gpu=4,mem=256G                clip         500                                   cpu=564,mem=5590G                 cml         500                                    cpu=1128,mem=11T         cml-furongh         500       cml-scavenger         500                    gres/gpu=24            cml-zhou         500               gamma         500                                   cpu=648,mem=5454G                mbrc         500                                   cpu=240,mem=2345G                 mc2         500                                   cpu=312,mem=3092G               oasis         500               quics         500                                   cpu=328,mem=3484G           scavenger         500  cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G                tron         500     cpu=32,gres/gpu=4,mem=256G              vulcan         500                                 cpu=1392,mem=12833G       vulcan-ampere         500          vulcan-cpu         500       vulcan-ramani         500    vulcan-scavenger         500NOTE: These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS (i.e., they are not in the AllowQos field for their respective partition). Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.For example, in the default non-preemption partition (tron), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition.Lab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two "TRES" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition.All partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill (https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html#backfill)  issues with the SLURM scheduler.If you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an "outer submission script" that repeatedly attempts to run an "inner submission script" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval.An example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an  array job, and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less.#!/bin/bashnumjobs=1000i=0while [ $i -lt $numjobs ]do  while [[ "$(sbatch example_inner.sh 2>&1)" =~ "QOSMaxSubmitJobPerUserLimit" ]]  do    echo "Currently at maximum job submissions allowed."    echo "Waiting for 5 minutes before trying to submit more jobs."    sleep 300  done  i=$(( $i + 1 ))  echo "Submitted job $i of $numjobs"doneIt is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.Section: StorageAll network storage available in Nexus is currently NFS based, and comes in a few different flavors. Compute nodes also have local storage that can be used.Section: Home DirectoriesYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.Section: Scratch DirectoriesScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Nexus compute infrastructure:Network scratch directoriesLocal scratch directoriesPlease note that  class accounts do not have network scratch directories.Section: Network Scratch DirectoriesYou are allocated 200GB of scratch space via NFS from /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME> where <USERNAME> is your UMIACS username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is  automounted; you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access it.You can view your quota usage by running df -h /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>.You may request a permanent increase of up to 400GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 400GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a  project allocation for this. If you choose to increase your scratch space beyond 400GB, the increased space is also subject to the 270 TB days limit mentioned in the project allocation section before we check back in for renewal. For example, if you request 1.4TB total space, you may have this for 270 days (1TB beyond the 400GB permanent increase). The amount increased beyond 400GB will also count against your faculty member's 20TB total storage limit mentioned below.This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.Section: Local Scratch DirectoriesEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on also has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc. and are not backed up or protected in any way.  These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job as they are mounted from disks directly attached to the compute node.  However, you must stage your data within the confines of your job and extract the relevant resultant data elsewhere before the end of your job.These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our  monthly maintenance windows.  Please make sure you secure any resultant data you wish to keep from these directories at the end of your job.Section: Faculty AllocationsEach faculty member can be allocated 1TB of permanent lab space upon request.  We can also support grouping these individual allocations together into larger center, lab, or research group allocations if desired by the faculty.  Please  contact staff to inquire.Lab space storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.Section: Project AllocationsProject allocations are available per user for 270 TB days; you can have a 1TB allocation for up to 270 days, a 3TB allocation for 90 days, etc..A single faculty member can not have more than 20TB of project allocations across all of their sponsored accounts active simultaneously. Network scratch allocation space increases beyond the 400GB permanent maximum also have the increase count against this limit (i.e., a 1TB network scratch allocation would have 600GB counted towards this limit).Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.The maximum allocation length you can request is 540 days (500GB space) and the maximum storage space you can request is 9TB (30 day length).To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:Project Name (short)DescriptionSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)Length in days (270 days, 135 days, etc.)Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if anyThese allocations are available via /fs/nexus-projects/<project name>.  Renewal is not guaranteed to be available due to limits on the amount of total storage.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you are still in need of the storage allocation.  If renewal is available, you can renew for up to another 270 TB days with reapproval from the original faculty approver.If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.Section: DatasetsWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/nexus-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.The list of Nexus datasets we currently host can be viewed here (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Nexus) .Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus&oldid=12024"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Show_available_nodes has the title Section: SLURM/JobSubmission and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from Show available nodes)Jump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Job Submission1.1 srun1.1.1 Common srun Arguments1.1.2 Interactive Shell Sessions1.2 salloc1.3 sbatch1.3.1 Advanced Batch Scripts1.3.2 More Examples1.3.3 scancel2 Identifying Resources and Features2.1 show_nodes2.1.1 Examples2.2 show_available_nodes2.2.1 Footnotes2.2.2 Examples3 Requesting GPUs4 MPI exampleSection: Job SubmissionSLURM offers a variety of ways to run jobs. It is important to understand the different options available and how to request the resources required for a job in order for it to run successfully. All job submission should be done from submit nodes; any computational code should be run in a job allocation on compute nodes. The following commands outline how to allocate resources on the compute nodes and submit processes to be run on the allocated nodes.The cluster that everyone with a  UMIACS account has access to is Nexus. Please visit the Nexus page for instructions on how to connect to your assigned submit nodes.Computationally intensive processes run on submission nodes will be terminated. Please submit jobs to be scheduled on compute nodes for this purpose.For details on how SLURM decides how to schedule jobs when multiple jobs are waiting in a scheduler's queue, please see SLURM/Priority.Section: srunThe srun command is used to run a process on the compute nodes in the cluster. If you pass it a normal shell command (or command that executes a script), it will submit a job to run that shell command/script on a compute node and then return. srun accepts many command line options to specify the resources required by the command passed to it. Some common command line arguments are listed below and full documentation of all available options is available in the man page for srun, which can be accessed by running man srun.$ srun --qos=default --mem=100mb --time=1:00:00 bash -c 'echo "Hello World from" `hostname`'Hello World from tron33.umiacs.umd.eduIt is important to understand that srun is an interactive command. By default input to srun is broadcast to all compute nodes running your process and output from the compute nodes is redirected to srun. This behavior can be changed; however, srun will always wait for the command passed to finish before exiting, so if you start a long running process and end your terminal session, your process will stop running on the compute nodes and your job will end. To run a non-interactive submission that will remain running after you logout, you will need to wrap your srun commands in a batch script and submit it with  sbatch.Section: Common srun Arguments--job-name=<JOBNAME> Requests your job be named <JOBNAME>--mem=1g Requests 1GB of memory for your job, if no unit is given MB is assumed--ntasks=2 Requests 2 "tasks" which map to cores on a CPU for your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each core--nodes=2 Requests 2 nodes be allocated to your job; if passed to srun, runs the given command concurrently on each node--nodelist=<NODENAME> Requests to run your job on the <NODENAME> node--time=dd-hh:mm:ss Requests your job run for dd days, hh hours, mm minutes, and ss seconds--error=<ERRNAME> Redirects stderr for your job to the <ERRNAME> file--partition=<PARTITIONNAME> Requests your job run in the <PARTITIONNAME> partition--qos=<QOSNAME>default Requests your job run with the <QOSNAME> QOS, to see the available QOS options on a cluster, run show_qos--account=<ACCOUNTNAME> Requests your job runs under the <ACCOUNTNAME> Slurm account, different accounts have different available partitions/QOS--output=<OUTNAME> Redirects stdout for your job to the <OUTNAME> file--requeue Requests your job be automatically requeued if it is preempted--exclusive Requests your job be the only one running on the node(s) it is assigned to. This requires that your job be allocated all of the resources on the node(s). The scheduler does not automatically give your job all of the node's/nodes' resources, however, so if you need more than the default, you still need to request these with --ntasks and --memSection: Interactive Shell SessionsAn interactive shell session on a compute node can be useful for debugging or developing code that isn't ready to be run as a batch job. To get an interactive shell on a node, use srun with the --pty argument to invoke a shell:$ srun --pty --qos=default --mem=1g --time=01:00:00 bash$ hostnametron33.umiacs.umd.eduPlease do not leave interactive shells running for long periods of time when you are not working. This blocks resources from being used by everyone else.Section: sallocThe salloc command can also be used to request resources be allocated without needing a batch script. Running salloc with a list of resources will allocate the resources you requested, create a job, and drop you into a subshell with the environment variables necessary to run commands in the newly created job allocation. When your time is up or you exit the subshell, your job allocation will be relinquished.$ salloc --qos=default -N 1 --mem=2g --time=01:00:00salloc: Granted job allocation 159$ srun /usr/bin/hostnametron33.umiacs.umd.edu$ exitexitsalloc: Relinquishing job allocation 159Please note that any commands not invoked with srun will be run locally on the submit node. Please be careful when using salloc.Section: sbatchThe sbatch command allows you to write a batch script to be submitted and run non-interactively on the compute nodes. To run a simple Hello World command on the compute nodes you could write a file, helloWorld.sh with the following contents:#!/bin/bashsrun bash -c 'echo Hello World from `hostname`'Then you need to submit the script with sbatch and request resources:$ sbatch --qos=default --mem=1g --time=1:00:00 helloWorld.shSubmitted batch job 121SLURM will return a job number that you can use to check the status of your job with squeue:$ squeue             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)               121      tron helloWor username  R       0:01      1 tron32Section: Advanced Batch ScriptsYou can also write a batch script with all of your resources/options defined in the script itself. This is useful for jobs that need to be run tens/hundreds/thousands of times. You can then handle any necessary environment setup and run commands on the resources you requested by invoking commands with srun. The srun commands can also be more complex and be told to only use portions of your entire job allocation, each of these distinct srun commands makes up one "job step". The batch script will be run on the first node allocated as part of your job allocation and each job step will be run on whatever resources you tell them to. In the following example, we have a batch job that will request 2 nodes in the cluster. We then load a specific version of Python into our environment and submit two job steps, each one using one node. Since srun is blocks until the command finishes, we use the '&' operator to background the process so that both job steps can run at once; however, this means that we then need to use the wait command to block processing until all background processes have finished.#!/bin/bash# Lines that begin with #SBATCH specify commands to be used by SLURM for scheduling#SBATCH --job-name=helloWorld                                        # sets the job name#SBATCH --output=helloWorld.out.%j                                   # indicates a file to redirect STDOUT to; %j is the jobid.

It can be passed individual job IDs or an option to delete all of your jobs or jobs that meet certain criteria.scancel 255 cancel job 255scancel 255.3 cancel job step 3 of job 255scancel --user

The default unit is MB if unspecified, but any of {K,M,G,T} can be suffixed to the number provided (will then be interpreted as KB, MB, GB, or TB, respectively).GRES-related arguments:--gres, --and-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains all of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings.--or-gres: Only include nodes whose list of GRES contains any of the specified GRES type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gres if only one GRES type/quantity pairing is specified.GPU-related arguments:--gpus, --and-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains all of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings.--or-gpus: Only include nodes whose list of GPUs (a subset of GRES) contains any of the specified GPU type/quantity pairings. Functionally identical to --and-gpus if only one GPU type/quantity pairing is specified.Feature-related arguments:--feature, --and-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains all of the specified feature(s).--or-feature: Only include nodes whose list of features contains any of the specified feature(s). Functionally identical to --and-feature if only one feature is specified.These arguments are also viewable by running show_available_nodes -h.If your passed argument set does not contain any resource-based arguments (CPUs/RAM/GRES or GPUs), a node is defined as available if it has at least 1 CPU and 1MB of RAM available.If there are no nodes available that meet your passed argument set, you will receive the message There are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.Section: Footnotes[0] - As of now, this command alias does not factor in resources occupied by jobs that could be preempted (based on the partition(s) passed to it, if present). This is soon to come.[1] - This command alias also does not factor in jobs with higher priority values requesting more resources, in the same partition(s), blocking execution of a job submitted with the arguments checked by the command alias. This is due to the complexity of calculating a job's priority value before it is actually submitted.Section: ExamplesShow all available nodes:$ show_available_nodesbrigid17  cpus=16,mem=414593Mbrigid18  cpus=8,mem=24875M...Show nodes available in the tron partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition trontron00  cpus=14,mem=50433M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:1tron01  cpus=10,mem=17665M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:2...Show nodes with one or more RTX A5000 or RTX A6000 GPUs available to the vulcan account:$ show_available_nodes --account vulcan --or-gpus rtxa5000:1,rtxa6000:1vulcan32  cpus=16,mem=193778M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:4vulcan33  cpus=15,mem=181499M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:3...Show nodes with 4 or more CPUs, 48G or more memory, and one or more RTX A6000 GPUs available in the scavenger partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --cpus=4 --mem=48g --or-gpus=rtxa6000:1cbcb27  cpus=59,mem=218303M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:6clip06  cpus=20,mem=93448M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:1...Show nodes with Turing (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/turing)  or Ampere (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture)  architecture GPUs available in the scavenger partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --or-feature=Ampere,Turingcbcb25  cpus=24,mem=255278M,gres=gpu:rtx2080ti:1,gpu:gtx1080ti:1cbcb26  cpus=127,mem=447707M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:7...Show nodes with Zen (https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/zen-core)  architecture CPUs and Ampere (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture)  architecture GPUs available in the scavenger partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=scavenger --and-feature=Zen,Amperecbcb26  cpus=127,mem=447707M,gres=gpu:rtxa5000:7cbcb27  cpus=59,mem=218303M,gres=gpu:rtxa6000:6...(bogus example) Attempt to show nodes available in the bogus partition:$ show_available_nodes --partition=bogusThere are no nodes that have currently free resources that meet this argument set.Section: Requesting GPUsIf you need to do processing on a GPU, you will need to request that your job have access to GPUs just as you need to request processors or CPU cores. In SLURM, GPUs are considered "generic resources" also known as GRES. To request some number of GPUs be reserved/available for your job, you can use the flag --gres=gpu:# (with the actual number of GPUs you want). If there are multiple types of GPUs available in the cluster and you need a specific type, you can provide the type option to the gres flag e.g. --gres=gpu:rtxa5000:#. If you do not request a specific type of GPU, you are likely to be scheduled on an older, lower spec'd GPU.Note that some QoSes may have limits on the number of GPUs you can request per job, so you may need to specify a different QoS to request more GPUs.$ srun --pty --qos=medium --gres=gpu:2 nvidia-smi...Wed Mar  6 16:59:39 2024+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| NVIDIA-SMI 535.129.03             Driver Version: 535.129.03   CUDA Version: 12.2     ||-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus) and doesn't provide administrative control to users on them.  While Docker (https://www.docker.com)  is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.Apptainer was previously branded as Singularity.  You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity, however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.Section: Contents1 Overview2 Nexus Containers2.1 Bind Mounts2.2 Shared Containers3 Docker Workflow ExampleSection: OverviewYou can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command.

To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.If you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory.

Multi-factor solutions ensure that you have something you know (i.e. your password) and something you have (phone/tablet/token) when trying to authenticate.  This ensures that phishing and other attempts to secure your password do not result in an account compromise and protect you and your data from unauthorized access.Enrollment is discrete and must be done for both UMD (if you have a UMD appointment) and UMIACS individually.  You can enroll the same phone for both of these services, but not the same hardware token (if you use a token for UMD already).  The UMIACS Single Sign-On and our VPN require Duo authentication.Do not share a registered Duo authentication factor with any other UMIACS user for any purpose. Action may be taken against your account if you do so. Duo Login PromptSection: Contents1 Enrollment2 Management3 Offline Use4 Services5 FAQSection: EnrollmentPlease refer to Duo's Enrollment (https://guide.duo.com/enrollment)  guide which has comprehensive information on how to enroll your devices.  Your initial sign in for enrollment purposes must be done via our Directory application (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/auth/login) .We encourage users to enroll with their smart phone as it provides the most seamless experience.  We also support iOS/Android Tablets, landlines, and U2F FIDO (https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/)  authenticator tokens (though these do not work with our VPN or MFA SSH services).Section: ManagementUsers can manage their UMIACS Duo settings as part of the required login to the Directory Application (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/info) .  Please follow the Duo guide for Managing Devices (https://guide.duo.com/manage-devices)  when you see the Duo login prompt.We suggest you register using a mobile phone or tablet that is always in your personal possession.  If/When you upgrade or dispose of your currently registered phone/tablet, please consider enrolling your new device before getting rid of your old device.  Activation of your new device will require you to successfully authenticate with a currently registered device.  If you no longer have the device but have kept the same phone number, you can select Call Me to have Duo call you to authenticate your session to manage/enroll your devices.  If you do not have access to your previous device(s) or the phone number, you will need to  contact staff for assistance.Section: Offline UseDuo Offline One-Time CodeEntering Your CodeFor use when phone data or calls are not available, there are 2 options. You may use the Duo App on their phone or tablet—without any internet connection—to generate one-time codes that will allow you to authenticate to Duo.  This code will be the input for the secondary login screen for the VPN or the passcode option in the Duo pane of web authentication.  To get a code from the app, open the app and tap on the entry labeled "Duo-protected UMIACS."  This will present a 6 digit passcode.Alternatively, YubiKey hardware tokens can be used with Duo. Hardware tokens must be enrolled by the Technical staff, so if you are interested in procuring a hardware token for use with Duo, please  contact staff. We only support registering YubiKey tokens for this purpose, no other hardware token.Section: ServicesThe following UMIACS services are secured with our Duo MFA solution.GitLabJira Object StorageVPNDirectory (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory) Requests (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests) MediaWiki log ins SSH (when coming in from off-campus)Section: FAQI can no longer clone HTTPS Git repositories in GitLab. How do I work around this?Since we now require more than just your username/password to log into GitLab, you cannot use your UMIACS credentials directly for accessing HTTPS Git repositories.  We encourage you to setup an SSH key (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/ssh/README.md#ssh)  instead.  If you have a case where you need to use HTTPS, you can use a Personal Access Token (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/help/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md)  to accomplish this.  Ensure that you create the token with API scope.  You would then use your username as normal and use the token as the password.  Treat this token as a personal secret, as it is sufficient to act as your account within GitLab.How do I authenticate with a Token?We only currently support YubiKey tokens for our Duo deployment.  You can follow the instructions from Yubico (https://guide.duo.com/tokens) ; you will need to tap the YubiKey once you select the Enter a Passcode field.  It will create a passcode (will look something like kffuastenhldrhfhadafdarivuntddugrvjvllddjjuget) and send a return.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Duo&oldid=11954"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SSH/Keys has the title Section: SSH/Keys and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSSH can utilize public key encryption to authenticate and authorize users.

If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.Additional ConsiderationsThe  SSH Agents section is not a required component of creating and using an SSH key, but can be very useful if you choose to create a password to protect your SSH key, but find yourself needing to enter that password many times in a session.  SSH Agents allow you to temporarily use your SSH key without a password for a set period of time. Please see the  SSH Agents section for more information.Section: Create and store the key pairThe first step is to generate a key which will create two files filled with long strings of characters.  A public key file that you may distribute to any machine you want to use it on and a private key that needs to be kept secure.  Allowing anyone to read this private key will compromise the security of the key and could allow someone to access any resources secured by this key without your consent. There are a number of different key types but rsa is the most compatible.

It will prompt you for a file to create the private key and then for the public key append .pub extension and store it in the same directory.  Pressing enter at the passphrase step twice will create a key without a pass-phrase.Note: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with 'id', such as 'id_umiacs_rsa'.Example: -bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsaGenerating public/private rsa key pair.Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):Created directory '/home/username/.ssh'.Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):Enter same passphrase again:Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.The key fingerprint is:32:bf:db:74:1b:7e:d7:c6:4b:b5:6f:a8:82:55:3f:bf username@localhost.localdomainThe key's randomart image is:+--[ RSA 2048]----+|                 ||                 ||                 ||            .    ||      o S  . .  .||       +  .   o o||        .o. o  B.||        .+.o o+ O||        o...+o E+|+-----------------+Create a new key without a passwordYou can simplify the existing example above by telling it you do not want a pass-phrase and can run the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "".Note: If you change the file in which to save the key, please ensure that it still starts with 'id', such as 'id_umiacs_rsa'.Example: -bash-4.2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ""Generating public/private rsa key pair.Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):Created directory '/home/username/.ssh'.Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.The key fingerprint is:ff:7a:99:28:fc:63:d6:10:44:4c:2e:68:76:44:76:7a username@localhost.localdomainThe key's randomart image is:+--[ RSA 2048]----+|       .+++      ||       + +o      ||      + +.E      ||     o . o.      ||        S  .     ||         ..      ||       .  .+ o   ||        o =.=    ||         =o+.    |+-----------------+Modify permissionsModify the permissions of your .ssh directory as well as the private key file that you just created with chmod.chmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsaIf you named your file something other than id_rsa, change id_rsa to the name of the file.Section: Copy the public keyOnce you have a generated a key pair you will want to add it to one or more computers to allow you to access them.  Section: WindowsFor Windows hosts you can use WinSCP (http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)  to copy the public key file onto a remote host. The root file system for the Bash Subsystem for Windows is located under C:\Users\username>\AppData\Local\lxss\Section: NoneThis can be done with the ssh-copy-id command and it will prompt you the first time for your current password (NOT your pass-phrase). You can replace localhost with any other hostname you want to copy the key to. You can also specify an alternate user or identity file if you need to, please man ssh-copy-id for more information within your terminal. This command will ensure that not only it copies your key but secures the file so that no one can tamper and add additional authorized keys to the file on the remote host. Example: -bash-4.2$ ssh-copy-id localhost/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keysusername@localhost's password:Number of key(s) added: 1Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'localhost'"and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.Section: NonePuTTYOpen PuTTY and enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)  for the host you wish to connect to.Go to the Connections tab on the side panel and click on the data subsection.Under data enter your default user into the first box.

When creating a key for use with SLURM, follow the above instructions for creating keys without passwords.After creating this key pair please make sure you follow the  copy the public key instructions above to localhost. This will ensure that your key will be usable on all the cluster nodes since they have a shared home directory.Section: SSH AgentsWhile it is very useful to protect your SSH key pair with a pass-phrase it can very time consuming to re-type the pass-phrase over and over. SSH provides a agent that runs in the background and allow you add a key(s) to it with a time limit that they will be unlocked for.ssh-agent bashssh-add -t $TIMEThe time specified by -t is specified in seconds.Example:(The following would start a bash shell with passwordless SSH active for 30 minutes.)ssh-agent bashssh-add -t 1800You will be prompted for your passphrase and, when entered correctly, you will be able to SSH without entering a password. You can check what keys are load when you are running inside a ssh-agent by using the command ssh-add -l.Example: bash-4.2$ ssh-add -l2048 ee:83:10:c8:2f:2c:17:5e:ef:80:42:7e:ff:75:9e:53 /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SSH/Keys&oldid=11867"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/RStudio has the title Section: RStudio and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchInstructions to install RStudio on WindowsSection: Contents1 Requirements2 Retrieving Installation Files3 Using the Installer4 Running RStudioSection: RequirementsTo use RStudio, you will need an R environment set up.

In the context of a cluster job, the data being processed, as well as any generated results, should be stored on a disk physically installed in the compute node itself.  We'll cover how to identify local disk space later on this page.Section: General WorkflowThe following is a suggested workflow for a computational job:Copy the data to be processed to the local compute node.Process the data, storing results on local disk space.Once processing is finished, transfer results to permanent storage location. (i.e. a network file share)Clean up data and results from compute node local disk space.Section: Why this mattersSimilar to how too many processes on a single machine can slow it down, too many users accessing a network file server can impact performance.  This issue is further compounded in the context of cluster jobs, as a single user can generate hundreds if not thousands of jobs all trying to access the same network fileserver.  By utilizing the local disks on the compute nodes, you effectively distribute the data access load and reduce the load on the central fileserver.Following these best practices isn't just about being a good neighbor however, they will also improve the performance of your jobs.To further illustrate this issue, consider a service like Netflix.  While Netflix invests heavily in their data storage and supporting network, if they allowed their customers to access it directly it would quickly reach capacity resulting in performance degradation for all users.  In order to accommodate this Netflix distributes it's data into various caching tiers, which are much closer to the end user.  This distribution evens the load across multiple different devices, increasing the performance and availability for all users.While UMIACS obviously does not operate at the same scale as Netflix, the same issues are still present within the compute infrastructure.  Processing data that resides on local disk space reduces the load on the central file server and improves the performance of the process.Section: Data StorageWhen possible, it is recommended that data be stored in an archive file.Utilizing archive files provide the following benefits:Faster data transfersReduced data sizeEasier data management.Practically every filesystem in existence has limitations in it's ability to handle large numbers of small files.  By grouping large collections of small files into a single archive file we reduce the impact of this limitation, as well as improve the efficiency of data storage when combined with techniques such as compression.  Another advantage manifests when transferring data over the network.  In order to transfer a file a connection to the remote location has to be established and closed for each file, which can add significant overhead when dealing with large numbers of files.  When the files are collected into a single archive file we reduce the number of connections that are created and destroyed, and focus more on streaming data.  Common utilities for creating archive files are tar and zip.Section: Identifying Local Disk SpaceLocal disk storage at UMIACS typically conforms to the following guidelines:Directory name starts with /scratchAlmost every UMIACS supported machine has a /scratch0Machines with multiple local disks will have multiple /scratchX directories, where X is a number that increases with the number of disks.# Output shortened for brevity.-bash-4.2$ lsblk NAME               MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTsda                  8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk └─sda2               8:2    0 930.5G  0 part   ├─vol00-scratch0 253:3    0   838G  0 lvm  /scratch0sdb                  8:16   0   477G  0 disk └─sdb1               8:17   0   477G  0 part /scratch1sdc                  8:32   0 953.9G  0 disk └─sdc1-scratch2    253:2    0 953.9G  0 lvm  /scratch2As shown above, common utilities such as lsblk can be used to identify the specific configuration on a given node.Local data storage is considered transitory and as such is not backed up.  It is not intended for long-term storage of critical/sensitive data.If you have any questions about the available local disk storage on a given cluster please refer to the documentation specific for that cluster, or contact  the UMIACS Help Desk.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Compute/DataLocality&oldid=7418"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Service/Compute/Virtualization has the title Section: Service/Compute/Virtualization and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchstub.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Service/Compute/Virtualization&oldid=6743"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Perl/Environment has the title Section: Perl/Environment and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchWe recommend using local::lib to create your own directory of Perl packages downloaded from CPAN.

These accounts can access resources such as GitLab, UMobjstore, Wikis, and other web-based applications. These accounts do not have storage and access to UMIACS workstations, however.Section: NoneA UMIACS Account holder has to sponsor the Collaborator Account.   This is done in our UMIACS Requests Application (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/requests/accounts/collaborators/new) .  This will send an email to the Collaborator to set their details (including a username and password).  Once the Collaborator has created their account, an email will be sent to both the account sponsor and the Collaborator that the account is ready to use.Section: Services OfferedCollaborators can access GitLab, the Object Store, as well as other web applications.Section: GitLabGitLab is a source code collaboration software based on Git (https://git-scm.com/)  source control management.  It supports built-in project wikis, code review, and issue tracking for each project.  All Collaborators automatically get GitLab access.  Although Collaborators can modify any of the repos you add them to, they do not get an allocation to create projects of their own.Section: Object StoreUMobjstore is the web application component complementing UMobj, the command-line utility used to interact with the Object Store. UMobjstore gives users a convenient interface to our Ceph Object Stores which are distributed across different machines, so that machines can fail and the cluster keep functioning.Section: WikisWikis are great for providing collaborative web spaces. In order to access a particular wiki, a Collaborator will first have to be added to the respective SecGroup.Section: Controlling Access to your CollaboratorsSection: Security GroupsSecGroup are authentication groups that give PIs the ability to manage which users should have access to different applications that they manage.  They provide fine-grained access control to wikis, source code repositories, and certain web applications.Section: Viewing Security GroupsYou can view which SecGroups you can grant access to through the directory app: https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/ (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/secgroup/) Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Working_with_External_Collaborators&oldid=7984"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/ConferenceRooms/TouchPanel has the title Section: ConferenceRooms/TouchPanel and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchAll  conference rooms in the  Brendan Iribe Center and some in the  Atlantic Building come equipped with touch panels that can be used to control the video and audio source(s) and level(s) being used to project to the display(s) in the room.Section: Contents1 Basic Usage1.1 Moderated Rooms1.2 Auto-Accept Rooms1.3 Huddle Rooms2 Common Options2.1 Solstice2.2 Laptop Device2.3 Room PC3 Shutting DownSection: Basic UsageAssuming the room was previously in a 'shut down' state, the display will look like this when you first come up to it.Touch the panel as directed to start it up. This will turn on the display(s) for the room and lower the projector screens if any are present.Once the startup completes, you will see a number of different options depending on what the capabilities of the room are:Section:  Moderated RoomsThese (larger) rooms have a number of options for sources to display and multiple places to display them to. All of the source options available in the smaller conference rooms are also available in these rooms. The exact options on each moderated room's panel may vary, as the capabilities vary room to room.Of note in these rooms specifically is the "Device Control" option at the top of the source/destination menu, which takes you to another menu where you can manage volume, and (in some rooms) lighting, microphones, and settings for other integrated devices such as the room's Blu-ray player, TV tuner, or room cameras. This is also where you mute or unmute the lectern mic, if there is one.Section:  Auto-Accept RoomsThese rooms have the ability to display an external device's screen wirelessly using  Solstice, an external device's screen wired via HDMI, or the room PC's screen (the room PC is attached to the back of the display in the room).Section:  Huddle RoomsThese rooms have the ability to display an external device's screen wirelessly using  Solstice or wired via HDMI. They do not have room PCs, so you must bring your own device(s).Section: Common OptionsThe three source options you will commonly choose from on these panels are "Solstice", "Laptop Device" (just "Laptop" on some panels), and "Room PC" (the third option only in non-huddle rooms).In auto-accept and huddle rooms, the volume control for each of these sources can be found one you select that source. In moderated rooms, the volume control is on the Device Control menu, as mentioned above.Section: SolsticeThis option will prompt you to look at the display in the room for instructions on how to display your device(s) to the room's display wirelessly. More specific instructions can be found  here. Note that the room-specific details (IP address, room code) have been blacked out in the below photo for privacy reasons, but will show properly when you are physically in a room.Section: Laptop DeviceConnect your device to either the HDMI cable or VGA/aux cables coming out of the middle of the desk in the room to display your device to the room's display over a wired connection.Section: Room PCUse the wireless keyboard/mouse combo on the desk in the room to use the room PC. Choose the Conference account to sign into, which does not need a password. Please be sure to log off when you are done using the room PC, as the account is fully wiped when you log off, ensuring the next group using the room does not have access to anything you may have signed into.Section: Shutting DownPlease be sure to touch the "Shutdown A/V System" button when you are done using the room to save energy and give the next group using the room a clean slate. This will turn off the display(s) for the room and raise the projector screens if any are present.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=ConferenceRooms/TouchPanel&oldid=10130"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/WebSensitiveInformation has the title Section: WebSensitiveInformation and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: OverviewIn order to maintain maximum security, we do not store any sensitive information on our web servers. Such information is encrypted in memory upon receipt and sent to a designated email address, the owner of which will decrypt it using a email encryption/decryption program.The recommended email encryption/decryption software at UMIACS is WinPT (Windows Privacy Tray), a small and powerful software from http://winpt.wald.intevation.org/ (http://winpt.wald.intevation.org/) . It is freely available to all users. It must be noted that you need GnuPG 1.4.11 or higher installed on your computer to use WinPT. You can download GnuPG for free from the GnuPG website (https://www.gnupg.org/) .Section: WinPT InstructionsThe first time you run this program, you will be asked to generate your "keypair". A keypair contains a public key, which is usually used for encryption, and a private key, which is used for decryption.Now you are ready to encrypt and decrypt messages. To do so: Simply copy the text you wish to encrypt/decrypt into the Windows clipboard (i.e., use "copy" or "ctrl-v")Click on the WinPT icon in the lower-right corner of the screenSelect the approriate menu itemFollow the on-screen prompts.To have others send you encrypted messages, you must give them your public key. To do so:export your public key (There are three different ways to do this, reference this manual (http://www.mavi1.org/web_security/cryptography/pgp/gnupg-frontend/WinPT/winpt-handbook-0.2rc2.pdf)  to decide which is best for you.), and send it to the other side. Never distribute your private key.In the case of the standard UMIACS setup for accepting sensitive information online, such as credit card information, social security number, etc, it is mandatory that we use encrypted messages. Send your public key to webmaster@umiacs.umd.edu and clearly indicate which online form this is for.Section: Extra LinksFor an even more in-depth guide, consult this (http://sebsauvage.net/winpt_en.html)  over-simplified WinPT Tutorial.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=WebSensitiveInformation&oldid=6209"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/MacOSPrinting has the title Section: MacOSPrinting and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchWe support printing from user managed macOS 13.x or later machines. Note: You must be on a UMIACS network directly or connected to the VPN in order to print.Section: System SettingsTo start, open your System Settings from the Dock or Applications folder.  Once you have opened it, click Printers & Scanners.Section: NoneOn the Printers & Scanners page,  create a new local printer by clicking the Add Printer, Scanner, or Fax... button that is below the printer list.Section: Add PrinterThis will bring up the Add Printer dialog.Note: If you just want basic printing, use the steps below. If you would like to enable all the advanced options for the printer, jump over this section to "Enabling Advanced Printer Options".Jump over to the IP tabSet Protocol to Internet Printing Protocol - IPPSet Address to print.umiacs.umd.eduSet the Queue to printers/queue; in this example for cps432-3208 it would be printers/cps432-3208.  You have to make sure the queue is prefixed by printers/. For clarification, the queue is typically the printer name.Set Name to the name of the printer you are trying to use. This makes it easily Identifiable in your list of printers.It will always select Generic Postscript Printer.  If you need to access the more advanced features of a queue/printer or you were not able to print by choosing Generic Postscript Printer, you will need to take extra steps, please see the Advanced section at the bottom of this page.Select AddYou will be asked about enabling duplex. If you know the printer has the option, which is true for most of our printers, go ahead and enable it. Then hit OK. If you're not sure, just leave it disabled. You can always enable it after the queue is added.You should now be able to print to this printer/queue from any macOS print menu.Section: Enabling Advanced Printer FeaturesSome printers may have features not accessible with the default drivers provided above. If this is the case, follow the guide below to identify, and install your print drivers from their manufacturer.Note: If you already installed the printer with generic drivers, you will need to highlight the printer and click -, before attempting to add it again. You may also need a system update to get the latest drivers from Apple, if your printer does not have software drivers listed in the next steps.Step 1:  Locate your printers name and search for its Make and Model here: http://print.umiacs.umd.edu/printers/ (http://print.umiacs.umd.edu/printers/) Step 2:  Follow the Add Printer steps above until you get to Generic Postscript Printer. Select Software, then Add.Step 3:  A window labeled "Printer Software" will now pop up. Scroll through the list to find your specific make and model of printer. Click on it, and hit Ok.NOTE: If you cannot find the printer's make and model and need Advanced Printing Features, try downloading the drivers from Apple's website (https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1888?locale=en_US%7C)  and reinstalling the printer from step 1.Step 4:  Click Add on the next window and it should install your printer's software suite. You should have a list of options (if they are available) that looks similar this:Final Step: Enable the Options you wish to use, Click OK.

Details on common nodes already in the cluster (Tron partition) can be found  here.Please  contact staff with any questions or concerns.Section: Contents1 Usage2 Nodes3 Partitions4 Accounts5 QoS6 Storage6.1 Home Directories6.2 Scratch Directories6.2.1 Network Scratch Directory6.2.2 Local Scratch Directories6.3 Datasets6.4 Project Storage6.5 Object Storage7 Migration7.1 Home DirectoriesSection: UsageYou can SSH to nexusvulcan.umiacs.umd.edu to log in to a submission host.If you store something in a local directory (/tmp, /scratch0) on one of the two submission hosts, you will need to connect to that same submission host to access it later. The actual submission hosts are:nexusvulcan00.umiacs.umd.edunexusvulcan01.umiacs.umd.eduAll partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone Vulcan cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named vulcan in the standalone cluster (it is also named just vulcan in Nexus).Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:Standalone Vulcan cluster submission commandNexus cluster submission commandsrun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bashsrun --partition=vulcan-dpart --qos=vulcan-medium --account=vulcan-abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bashsrun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bashsrun --partition=vulcan-cpu --qos=vulcan-cpu --account=vulcan --pty bashsrun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bashsrun --partition=vulcan-scavenger --qos=vulcan-scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bashVulcan users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on Vulcan nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the vulcan-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all vulcan## in aggregate nodes plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan.Please note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).Section: NodesThere are currently 46  GPU nodes available running a mixture of NVIDIA RTX A6000, NVIDIA RTX A5000, NVIDIA RTX A4000, NVIDIA Quadro P6000, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, and NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards. There are also 4 CPU-only nodes available.All nodes are scheduled with the SLURM resource manager.Section: PartitionsThere are three partitions available to general Vulcan SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.vulcan-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed. Only nodes with GPUs from architectures before NVIDIA's Ampere architecture (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)  are included in this partition.vulcan-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other vulcan- partitions are ready to be scheduled.vulcan-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.There are a few additional partitions available to subsets of Vulcan users based on specific requirements.vulcan-ampere - This partition contains nodes with GPUs from NVIDIA's Ampere architecture (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/) . Job allocations are guaranteed.As of Thursday 02/29/2024 at 12pm, there is a 4 hour time limit on interactive jobs in this partition. If you need to run longer jobs, you will need to modify your workflow into a job that can be submitted as a batch script.As of Thursday 03/21/2024 at 5pm, there is a limit of 4 CPUs and 48G memory maximum per GPU requested by a job. If you need to run jobs with more CPUs/memory, you will either need to request more GPUs in the job or use a different partition.Submission is restricted to the Slurm  accounts of the faculty who invested in these nodes:Abhinav Shrivastava (vulcan-abhinav)Jia-Bin Huang (vulcan-jbhuang)Christopher Metzler (vulcan-metzler)Matthias Zwicker (vulcan-zwicker)Section: AccountsVulcan has a base SLURM account vulcan which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in Vulcan compute infrastructure have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster.If you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the vulcan account.

Please also review UMIACS  Local Data Storage policies including any volume that is labeled as scratch.Vulcan users can also request  Nexus project allocations.Section: Home DirectoriesYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.Section: Scratch DirectoriesScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Vulcan compute infrastructure:Network scratch directoryLocal scratch directoriesSection: Network Scratch DirectoryYou have 300GB of scratch storage available at /vulcanscratch/<username>.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.You may request a temporary increase of up to 500GB total space for a maximum of 120 days without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  Once the temporary increase period is over, you will be contacted and given a one-week window of opportunity to clean and secure your data before staff will forcibly remove data to get your space back under 300GB.  If you need space beyond 500GB or for longer than 120 days, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory.This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.Section: Local Scratch DirectoriesEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage their data within the confine of their job and stage the data out before the end of their job.These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month at 1am.  Different nodes will run the maintenance jobs on different days of the month to ensure the cluster is still highly available at all times.  Please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.Section: DatasetsWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/vulcan-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.The list of Vulcan datasets we currently host can be viewed here (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Vulcan) .Section: Project StorageUsers within the Vulcan compute infrastructure can request project based allocations for up to 10TB for up to 180 days by  contacting staff with approval from the Vulcan faculty manager (Dr. Shrivastava).  These allocations will be available from /fs/vulcan-projects and /fs/cfar-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 180 days (requires re-approval from Dr. Shrivastava).If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.Section: Object StorageAll Vulcan users can request project allocations in the UMIACS Object Store (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help) . Please  contact staff with a short project name and the amount of storage you will need to get started.To access this storage, you'll need to use a  S3 client or our UMobj command line utilities.An example on how to use the umobj command line utilities can be found  here.  A full set of documentation for the utilities can be found on the umobj Gitlab page (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj) .Section: MigrationSection: Home DirectoriesThe Nexus uses NFShomes home directories - if your UMIACS account was created before February 22nd, 2023, you were using /cfarhomes/<username> as your home directory on the standalone Vulcan cluster. While /cfarhomes is available on Nexus, your shell initialization scripts from it will not automatically load. Please copy over anything you need to your /nfshomes/<username> directory at your earliest convenience, as /cfarhomes will be retired in a two phase process:Fri 11/17/2023, 5pm: cfarhomes directories are made read-onlyThu 12/21/2023, 5-8pm (monthly maintenance window): cfarhomes directories are taken offlineRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus/Vulcan&oldid=12037"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/FTP/Windows/Explorer has the title Section: FTP/Windows/Explorer and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchFTP services can be accessed from supported Windows machines.

This page offers best practices and guidelines for publishing your information using our resources. It also offers instructions for storing data that is within your allotted quota.Section: Contents1 Best Practices2 LabGroups3 OBJ Usage3.1 Uploading files/data3.2 Publishing WebsitesSection: Best PracticesWhen publishing anything, the following items are important to consider:Be sure that any/all data is published via a faculty member's account or a Labgroup (see below), not a student's (this is especially important when the data in question is meant to be permanent). This will reduce the chance of any broken links once the student leaves and their account is archived.OBJ (see below) should be used whenever data or websites are published.Make sure UMIACS is credited on any papers that contain UMIACS URLs.Section: LabGroupsLabGroups allow for multiple users to upload data to a central shared location. This is especially useful if multiple people are contributing to a single project. To learn more about LabGroups, visit The OBJ help page (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help)  or OBJ for more information. Section: OBJ UsageThe use of the  UMIACS Object Storage (otherwise known as OBJ) is the preferred method of publishing websites, data, and related info. Below are some short guides to publish websites and/or data on OBJ.Section: NoneAfter logging in to OBJ (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/) , select "Add Bucket".A "bucket" is essentially a folder that stores files.Upload any datasets or other files that contain the data you wish to publish.For publishing websites, continue to the "Publishing Websites" section. For datasets and the like continue on.In order to make any files publicly available, click the settings cog on the right side of the file, scroll down, and click "Make Key Public"Note that this makes this specific file available to anyone with the link. If you only wish to grant temporary access or access to a specific user, you may want to consider creating a timed download link or modifying the Access Control List at the bottom of the page. More information can be found on the OBJ help page (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help) Section: Publishing WebsitesGenerally, for publishing websites, you'll want to upload all your website files under one bucket. UMIACS recommends that you include an index.html file as well as a error file to be shown in case of a broken link (404). Once all these files are uploaded:In the bucket, click "bucket settings" at the top of the window.Under the "Website Hosting" section, put the name of your index file (usually just index.html) and the name of your 404 page.Click "Submit".Keep in mind that this will expose all data in your bucket. We recommend keeping any sensitive/access controlled data in a separate bucket.The website will be made public and can be reached using the link at the right side. In order to make the website non-public, simply click "Remove Website Configuration" and then "Make Private" in the above section.In addition to the above, there are more ways to add data to OBJ which can prove useful, especially if working with a lot of files.

The base editor itself is free, but some extensions may require paid subscriptions.Section: Contents1 Cluster Usage1.1 Best Practices1.1.1 Use only as a code editor1.1.2 Do not open large files1.1.3 Clean up when done2 Common IssuesSection: Cluster UsageIt can be convenient when using our SLURM computing clusters to open a connection to a VS Code Server (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server)  session on the submission node(s) that you have access to via VS Code's Remote - SSH extension (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) . Steps to set this up can be found here (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_installation) . Use your UMIACS username and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)  of the submission node you want to connect to. Password authentication does not provide an option to save your password, so for convenience, you may want to set up an  SSH key.For a list of active issues with the Remote - SSH extension, please see Microsoft's GitHub tracker here (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/labels/ssh) .Section: Best PracticesBecause of the multi-tenant nature of our submission nodes, using the Remote - SSH extension to connect to a VS Code Server running on a submission node can have adverse affects on other users simultaneously using the submission nodes if not properly managed. The following is a list of "best practices" that we ask you please follow to minimize the chance of impacting others on submission nodes. We have compiled the list through observation as well as through discussion with users.Section: Use only as a code editorVS Code can perform many common file management operations, such as moving, copying, or deleting files or directories. However, the overhead of providing progress updates / status messages through VS Code's UI can cause load spikes that result in other processes on the submission node (both system-level and other users') slowing down. This is especially the case if operating on thousands to millions of small image or video files. In extreme cases, it can seem as though the submission node is wholly unresponsive.The best way to combat this is to use VS Code as just a code editor as strictly as you can (meaning creating new and/or editing existing source code files only). Use standard command-line programs such as mv/cp/rm in VS Code's terminal window or a separate application's terminal window for local file management instead, or use the techniques advertised  here for larger data transfers between nodes.Section: Do not open large filesFiles that you open in VS Code's text editor on a remote machine through the Remote - SSH extension are loaded entirely into RAM on the remote machine. Because of the persistence of VS Code Server processes, opening several unique files may result in them all remaining in RAM for extended periods of time even if you no longer have tabs open for them in the Tab Bar.As such, please refrain from opening large files (more than a few MB) in VS Code itself on submission nodes. Either use a lighter-weight command-line based text editor such as vim (https://www.vim.org/)  or otherwise on the submission node itself, or first  transfer the files that you would like to open to either a less-used remote machine or your local machine before opening them.If you absolutely need to open one or more large files for a very brief period of time on a submission node, please clean up your server session on that node (see below section) as soon as possible when done.Section: Clean up when doneIf you are done using VS Code for an extended period of time (several hours / overnight), consider manually killing your server session on the submission node when exiting. By default, VS Code Server will keep the processes used by your session active for a few hours after you disconnect, keeping the VS Code Server processes on the submission node you were using alive, despite no longer actively being used.This can be done by opening the Command Palette (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)  (Ctrl+Shift+P) and searching "Kill VS Code Server on Host...".Select the submission node you were using and click on it.Wait a few seconds and you should get a message confirming the command went through.The next time you connect to the same submission node, you will have a fresh VS Code session on it.Section: Common IssuesIf you are having trouble SSH'ing to a submission node with VS Code, check if your home directory is full.Connect to one of your Nexus submission nodes via SSH not using VS Code. Remote connect to a serverNavigate to your home directory. cd ~Check if it is full. df -h .If it is full (Avail 0), delete some files to free up at least ~100MB of space.

If the system version is not sufficient, there are multiple versions of Python available via  GNU Modules.  If you find that you need a version of Python that is not currently available through GNU Modules, you can always build it from source (https://www.python.org/downloads/) .If you are using Windows, you can install your required version of Python without Administrator credentials.  Please see the  Windows Python page.Section: Python EnvironmentPython utilizes a variable called 'PYTHONPATH', which is similar to the PATH variable used in many shells.  The PYTHONPATH variable tells the Python interpreter where to look to find modules.To view your python path:bash:~$ python -c 'import sys; print sys.path'You can add directories to your PYTHONPATH either through your shell, or in your Python code itself:bash:~$ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/location/to/directory                 ...or...>>> sys.path.append('/location/to/directory')Section: Installing ModulesWhile some of the Versions of Python available in GNU modules provide a default set of modules pre-installed, you may wish to install your own.  Typically you will not have access to the global Python install location, so you will have to install modules using an alternative method.Section: NoneSection: NoneThe user scheme allows a user to install the module into the site userbase (python -c 'import site; print site.USER_BASE').  This file location is included in the PYTHONPATH by default.bash:~$ python setup.py install --userSection: NoneThe prefix scheme allows a user to install a module into a location of their choice.  Please note: This location will need to be added to the PYTHONPATH in order for the module to be found by the Python interpreter. bash:~$ python setup.py install --prefix="/path/to/location"Section:  Python Virtual EnvironmentA Python Virtual Environment is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects.

Users are arranged into a number of SLURM accounts based on faculty, lab, or center investments.Section: Contents1 Getting Started1.1 Access1.2 Jobs1.2.1 Interactive1.2.2 Batch2 Partitions3 Quality of Service (QoS)3.1 Job QoS3.2 Partition QoS4 Storage4.1 Home Directories4.2 Scratch Directories4.2.1 Network Scratch Directories4.2.2 Local Scratch Directories4.3 Faculty Allocations4.4 Project Allocations4.5 DatasetsSection: Getting StartedAll accounts in UMIACS are sponsored.  If you don't already have a UMIACS account, please see Accounts for information on getting one.  You need a full UMIACS account (not a  collaborator account) in order to access Nexus.Section: AccessYour access to submission nodes (alternatively called login nodes) for Nexus computational resources is determined by your account sponsor's department, center, or lab affiliation.  You can log into the UMIACS Directory CR application (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/cr/)  and select the Computational Resource (CR) in the list that has the prefix nexus.  The Hosts section lists your available submission nodes - generally a pair of nodes of the format nexus<department, lab, or center abbreviation>[00,01], e.g., nexusgroup00 and nexusgroup01.Note - UMIACS requires multi-factor authentication through our Duo instance.  This is completely discrete from both UMD's and CSD's Duo instances.  You will need to enroll one or more devices to access resources in UMIACS, and will be prompted to enroll when you log into the Directory application for the first time.Once you have identified your submission nodes, you can SSH directly into them.  From there, you are able to submit to the cluster via our SLURM workload manager.  You need to make sure that your submitted jobs have the correct account, partition, and qos.Section: JobsSLURM jobs are  submitted by either srun or sbatch depending if you are doing an interactive job or batch job, respectively.  You need to provide the where/how/who to run the job and specify the resources you need to run with.For the who/where/how, you may be required to specify --account, --partition, and/or --qos (respectively) to be able to adequately submit jobs to the Nexus.For resources, you may need to specify --time for time, --ntasks for CPUs, --mem for RAM, and --gres=gpu for GPUs in your submission arguments to meet your requirements.  There are defaults for all four, so if you don't specify something, you may be scheduled with a very minimal set of time and resources (e.g., by default, NO GPUs are included if you do not specify --gres=gpu).  For more information about submission flags for GPU resources, see  here.  You can also can run man srun on your submission node for a complete list of available submission arguments.For a list of available GPU types on Nexus and their specs, please see Nexus/GPUs.Section: InteractiveOnce logged into a submission node, you can run simple interactive jobs.  If your session is interrupted from the submission node, the job will be killed.  As such, we encourage use of a terminal multiplexer such as Tmux.$ srun --pty --ntasks=4 --mem=2gb --gres=gpu:1 nvidia-smi -LGPU 0: NVIDIA RTX A4000 (UUID: GPU-ae5dc1f5-c266-5b9f-58d5-7976e62b3ca1)Section: BatchBatch jobs are scheduled with a script file with an optional ability to embed job scheduling parameters via variables that are defined by #SBATCH lines at the top of the file.  You can find some examples in our SLURM/JobSubmission documentation.Section: PartitionsThe SLURM resource manager uses partitions to act as job queues which can restrict size, time and user limits.  The Nexus has a number of different partitions of resources.  Different Centers, Labs, and Faculty are able to invest in computational resources that are restricted to approved users through these partitions.Partitions usable by all non-class account users:Nexus/Tron - Pool of resources available to all UMIACS and CSD faculty and graduate students.Scavenger - Preemption (https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html)  partition that supports nodes from multiple other partitions.  More resources are available to schedule simultaneously than in other partitions, however jobs are subject to preemption rules.  You are responsible for ensuring your jobs handle this preemption correctly.  The SLURM scheduler will simply restart a preempted job with the same submission arguments when it is available to run again. For an overview of things you can check within scripts to determine if your job was preempted/resumed, see SLURM/Preemption.Partitions usable by ClassAccounts: Class - Pool available for UMIACS class accounts sponsored by either UMIACS or CSD faculty.Partitions usable by specific lab/center users:Nexus/CBCB - CBCB lab pool available for CBCB lab members.Nexus/CLIP - CLIP lab pool available for CLIP lab members.Nexus/CML - CML lab pool available for CML lab members.Nexus/GAMMA - GAMMA lab pool available for GAMMA lab members.Nexus/MBRC - MBRC lab pool available for MBRC lab members.Nexus/MC2 - MC2 lab pool available for MC2 lab members.Nexus/Vulcan - Vulcan lab pool available for Vulcan lab members.Section: NoneSLURM uses Quality of Service (QoS) both to provide limits on job sizes (termed by us as "job QoS") as well as to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user or per group (termed by us as "partition QoS").Section: Job QoSJob QoS are used to provide limits on the size of job that you can run. You should try to allocate only the resources your job actually needs, as resources that each of your jobs schedules are counted against your  fair-share priority in the future.default - Default job QoS. Limited to 4 CPU cores, 1 GPU, and 32GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 3 days.medium - Limited to 8 CPU cores, 2 GPUs, and 64GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 2 days.high - Limited to 16 CPU cores, 4 GPUs, and 128GB RAM per job.  The maximum wall time per job is 1 day.scavenger - No resource limits per job, only a maximum wall time per job of 3 days.  You are responsible for ensuring your job requests multiple nodes if it requests resources beyond what any one node is capable of.  576 total CPU cores, 72 total GPUs, and 2304GB total RAM are permitted simultaneously across all of your jobs running with this job QoS.  This job QoS is both only available in the scavenger partition and the only job QoS available in the scavenger partition. To use this job QoS, include --partition=scavenger and --account=scavenger in your submission arguments.  Do not include any job QoS argument other than --qos=scavenger (optional) or submission will fail.You can display these job QoS from the command line using the show_qos command.  By default, the command will only show job QoS that you can access.  The above four job QoS are the ones that everyone can access.$ show_qos                Name     MaxWall                        MaxTRES MaxJobsPU                      MaxTRESPU -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------- ------------------------------              default  3-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G                                                          high  1-00:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G                                                                                      medium  2-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G                                                     scavenger  3-00:00:00                                           cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G If you want to see all job QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_qos --all command. $ show_qos --all                Name     MaxWall                        MaxTRES MaxJobsPU                      MaxTRESPU -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------- ------------------------------              cml-cpu  7-00:00:00                                        8                                         cml-default  7-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G         2                                            cml-high  1-12:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G         2                                       cml-high_long 14-00:00:00              cpu=32,gres/gpu=8         8                     gres/gpu=8           cml-medium  3-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G         2                                       cml-scavenger  3-00:00:00                                                             gres/gpu=24        cml-very_high  1-12:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G         8                    gres/gpu=12              default  3-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G                                                          high  1-00:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G                                                       highmem 21-00:00:00                  cpu=32,mem=2T                                                     huge-long 10-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G                                                        medium  2-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G                                                     scavenger  3-00:00:00                                           cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G           vulcan-cpu  2-00:00:00                cpu=1024,mem=4T         4                                      vulcan-default  7-00:00:00       cpu=4,gres/gpu=1,mem=32G         2                                       vulcan-exempt  7-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G         2                                         vulcan-high  1-12:00:00     cpu=16,gres/gpu=4,mem=128G         2                                        vulcan-janus  3-00:00:00    cpu=32,gres/gpu=10,mem=256G                                                 vulcan-medium  3-00:00:00       cpu=8,gres/gpu=2,mem=64G         2                                       vulcan-sailon  3-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G                              gres/gpu=48     vulcan-scavenger  3-00:00:00     cpu=32,gres/gpu=8,mem=256G                                          To find out what accounts and partitions you have access to, first use the show_assoc command to show your account/job QoS combinations. Then, use the scontrol show partition command and note the AllowAccounts entry for each listed partition. You are able to submit to any partition that allows an account that you have. If you need to use an account other than the default account nexus, you will need to specify it via the --account submission argument.Section: Partition QoSPartition QoS are used to limit resources used by all jobs running in a partition, either per user (MaxTRESPU) or per group (GrpTRES).To view partition QoS, use the show_partition_qos command.$ show_partition_qos                Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------------------            scavenger         500  cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G                                      tron         500     cpu=32,gres/gpu=4,mem=256G                      If you want to see all partition QoS, including those that you do not have access to, you can use the show_partition_qos --all command. $ show_partition_qos --all                Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES -------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------------------                 Name MaxSubmitPU                      MaxTRESPU              GrpTRES-------------------- ----------- ------------------------------ --------------------                cbcb         500                                 cpu=1260,mem=50016G           cbcb-heng         500               class         500     cpu=32,gres/gpu=4,mem=256G                clip         500                                   cpu=564,mem=5590G                 cml         500                                    cpu=1128,mem=11T         cml-furongh         500       cml-scavenger         500                    gres/gpu=24            cml-zhou         500               gamma         500                                   cpu=648,mem=5454G                mbrc         500                                   cpu=240,mem=2345G                 mc2         500                                   cpu=312,mem=3092G               oasis         500               quics         500                                   cpu=328,mem=3484G           scavenger         500  cpu=576,gres/gpu=72,mem=2304G                tron         500     cpu=32,gres/gpu=4,mem=256G              vulcan         500                                 cpu=1392,mem=12833G       vulcan-ampere         500          vulcan-cpu         500       vulcan-ramani         500    vulcan-scavenger         500NOTE: These QoS cannot be used directly when submitting jobs, with the exception of the scavenger QoS (i.e., they are not in the AllowQos field for their respective partition). Partition QoS limits apply to all jobs running on a given partition, regardless of what job QoS is used.For example, in the default non-preemption partition (tron), you are restricted to 32 total CPU cores, 4 total GPUs, and 256GB total RAM at once across all jobs you have running in the partition.Lab/group-specific partitions may also have their own user limits, and/or may also have group limits on the total number of resources consumed simultaneously by all users that are using their partition, codified by the line in the output above that matches their lab/group name. Note that the values listed above in the two "TRES" columns are not fixed and may fluctuate per-partition as more resources are added to or removed from each partition.All partitions also only allow a maximum of 500 submitted (running (R) or pending (PD)) jobs per user in the partition simultaneously. This is to prevent excess pending jobs causing backfill (https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html#backfill)  issues with the SLURM scheduler.If you need to submit more than 500 jobs in batch at once, you can develop and run an "outer submission script" that repeatedly attempts to run an "inner submission script" (your original submission script) to submit jobs in the batch periodically, until all job submissions are successful. The outer submission script should use looping logic to check if you are at the max job limit and should then retry submission after waiting for some time interval.An example outer submission script is as follows. In this example, example_inner.sh is your inner submission script and is not an  array job, and you want to run 1000 jobs. If your inner submission script is an array job, adjust the number of jobs accordingly. Array jobs must be of size 500 or less.#!/bin/bashnumjobs=1000i=0while [ $i -lt $numjobs ]do  while [[ "$(sbatch example_inner.sh 2>&1)" =~ "QOSMaxSubmitJobPerUserLimit" ]]  do    echo "Currently at maximum job submissions allowed."    echo "Waiting for 5 minutes before trying to submit more jobs."    sleep 300  done  i=$(( $i + 1 ))  echo "Submitted job $i of $numjobs"doneIt is suggested that you run the outer submission script in a Tmux session to keep the terminal window executing it from being interrupted.Section: StorageAll network storage available in Nexus is currently NFS based, and comes in a few different flavors. Compute nodes also have local storage that can be used.Section: Home DirectoriesYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.Section: Scratch DirectoriesScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Nexus compute infrastructure:Network scratch directoriesLocal scratch directoriesPlease note that  class accounts do not have network scratch directories.Section: Network Scratch DirectoriesYou are allocated 200GB of scratch space via NFS from /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME> where <USERNAME> is your UMIACS username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is  automounted; you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access it.You can view your quota usage by running df -h /fs/nexus-scratch/<USERNAME>.You may request a permanent increase of up to 400GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 400GB, you will need faculty approval and/or a  project allocation for this. If you choose to increase your scratch space beyond 400GB, the increased space is also subject to the 270 TB days limit mentioned in the project allocation section before we check back in for renewal. For example, if you request 1.4TB total space, you may have this for 270 days (1TB beyond the 400GB permanent increase). The amount increased beyond 400GB will also count against your faculty member's 20TB total storage limit mentioned below.This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.Section: Local Scratch DirectoriesEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on also has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc. and are not backed up or protected in any way.  These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job as they are mounted from disks directly attached to the compute node.  However, you must stage your data within the confines of your job and extract the relevant resultant data elsewhere before the end of your job.These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our  monthly maintenance windows.  Please make sure you secure any resultant data you wish to keep from these directories at the end of your job.Section: Faculty AllocationsEach faculty member can be allocated 1TB of permanent lab space upon request.  We can also support grouping these individual allocations together into larger center, lab, or research group allocations if desired by the faculty.  Please  contact staff to inquire.Lab space storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.Section: Project AllocationsProject allocations are available per user for 270 TB days; you can have a 1TB allocation for up to 270 days, a 3TB allocation for 90 days, etc..A single faculty member can not have more than 20TB of project allocations across all of their sponsored accounts active simultaneously. Network scratch allocation space increases beyond the 400GB permanent maximum also have the increase count against this limit (i.e., a 1TB network scratch allocation would have 600GB counted towards this limit).Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.The maximum allocation length you can request is 540 days (500GB space) and the maximum storage space you can request is 9TB (30 day length).To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that the project is under involved in the conversation.  Please include the following details:Project Name (short)DescriptionSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)Length in days (270 days, 135 days, etc.)Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if anyThese allocations are available via /fs/nexus-projects/<project name>.  Renewal is not guaranteed to be available due to limits on the amount of total storage.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you are still in need of the storage allocation.  If renewal is available, you can renew for up to another 270 TB days with reapproval from the original faculty approver.If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.Section: DatasetsWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/nexus-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.The list of Nexus datasets we currently host can be viewed here (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Nexus) .Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus&oldid=12024"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/UNIXDataPolicies has the title Section: LocalDataStorage and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from UNIXDataPolicies)Jump to navigationJump to searchUMIACS recommends that any and all important data be stored on a redundant, backed-up file server.  However, there are a number of cases where this is not feasible.Section: Contents1 Windows Local Storage2 UNIX Remote Storage3 UNIX Local Storage4 Locally Attached Storage5 Network Scratch Storage6 UNIX Storage CommandsSection: Windows Local StorageWindows hosts at UMIACS store user directories on their local C drives. Supported, UMIACS-managed hosts automatically back up user data on the C drive nightly using the Institute's backup system. If you have a supported, UMIACS-managed host that has other internal or external hard drives attached to it, or partitions other than C on its primary hard drive, please be aware that these drives/partitions are not backed up. Laptops and non-standard hosts are not automatically backed up and should be manually backed up by their users.Section: UNIX Remote StorageWe provide storage to each of our users in our UNIX offerings through the NFShomes.This home directory,   /nfshomes/usernameis backed up nightly into our TSM backup system.  This volume has Snapshots enabled for easy user restores.Users are given a 30GB Quota. This quota is non-expandable and you will need to use either local or other network storage for increased space.Section: UNIX Local StorageUNIX machines use redundant, backed-up network file shares for user directories.  Research data storage is also stored on redundant, backed-up network file shares and is generally available under /fs/All UNIX machines also have local storage available for transitory use.  These directories may be used to store temporary, local COPIES of data that is permanently stored elsewhere or as a staging point for output.These directories may not, under any circumstances, be used as permanent storage for unique, important data.  UMIACS staff cannot recover damaged or deleted data from these directories and will not be responsible for data loss if they are misused. Additionally, on our SLURM compute clusters, these volumes may have an automated cleanup routine that will delete unmodified data after some number of days. You can check the page for the specific cluster you are using for more information.Please note that /tmp in particular is at risk for data loss or corruption as that directory is regularly used by system processes and services for temporary storage.These directories include: - /tmp - /scratch0, /scratch1, ... (/scratch#) - any directory named in whole or in part "tmp", "temp", or "scratch".Section: Locally Attached StorageLocally attached storage like USB flash drives and USB hard drives are very popular.  However, these devices are significantly more vulnerable to data loss or theft than internal or networked data storage.  In general, UMIACS discourages the use of locally attached network storage when any other option is available.  Please note that these devices are prone to high rates of failure and additional steps should be taken to ensure that the data is backed up and that critical or confidential data is not lost or stolen.Section: Network Scratch StorageSome labs have network-attached storage dedicated for scratch/temporary storage. These shares are named in the same manner as local scratch or temporary storage (i.e. /fs/lab-scratch or /lab/scratch0) and are subject to the same policies as local scratch/tmp (discussed above.)Section: UNIX Storage CommandsBelow are a few different CLI commands that may prove useful for monitoring your storage usage and performance. For additional information, run [command] --help or man [command]df - Shows descriptive file system informationUsage: df [OPTION]... [FILE]...Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides,or all file systems by default.du - Shows disk usage of specific files. Use the -d flag for better depth control.Usage: du [OPTION]... [FILE]...  or:  du [OPTION]... --files0-from=FSummarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.free - Shows current memory(RAM) usage. Use the -h flag for a human readable format.Usage: free [options]quota - Shows quota information, this is useful for viewing per filesystem limits in places such as a home directory. quota: Usage: quota [-guqvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat]	quota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -u username ...	quota [-qvswim] [-l | [-Q | -A]] [-F quotaformat] -g groupname ...	quota [-qvswugQm] [-F quotaformat] -f filesystem ...iostat - Shows drive utilization, as well as other utilizations.

For most people this file will be:Version: CurrentPlatform: RedHat / CentOS 7.0Package: tgzYou will need to create a custom mongod.conf configuration file, using the second link above as a guide. The important thing is to set a custom path for systemPath and dbPath. These must be directories that you own. Other than that, they can be anything you choose.Start the mongo server: "/path/to/bin/mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf". Since you are using a custom .conf file you will need to specify this when starting/stopping the server.Start the mongo client: "/path/to/bin/mongo".Once you are done, you can stop the server with "/path/to/bin/mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf --shutdown".Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=MongoDB&oldid=9923"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/OBJ/WebHosting has the title Section: OBJ/WebHosting and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchUMIACS'  Object Store has the ability to host websites. On the settings page for each bucket, there is a section allowing you to specify a configuration for a website hosted in your bucket. You can choose keys located in your bucket to act as the index file (what will be displayed when someone visits your website) and the error file (what will be displayed when an error is encountered loading your website). These settings can be updated at any time.Because hosting a website through your bucket requires others to have access to any keys associated with your website, setting up a website configuration will automatically set the visibility of your bucket to public and remove the bucket level ACLs. You will not be able to set the bucket back to private without first removing the website configuration, which can be done on the bucket settings page.Note: The Object Store only has the capability to support static content and client-side scripting in bucket websites.Section: Contents1 Hosting a Website2 Accessing the Website3 Setting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage4 Disabling a Website5 MiscSection: Hosting a WebsiteHosting a website in OBJ is quite easy and can be done in a few simple steps. There are three different ways you can set up your OBJ bucket to host a static website.First Method (Using the Web Interface):Log into OBJ (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/)  and create a bucket. Make sure to choose a bucket name carefully since this will be part of the web URL. Upload your index.html file and optional error.html file (and any other required files for your website) on the bucket that you just created.Once the files are uploaded, click on Bucket SettingsOn the settings page, click on the blue Make Public button. Under Website Hosting, enter the name of your index.html (and optionally error.html) file and hit Submit.Second Method (Using the UMobj CLI):Set up your environment variables.On the shell enter mkobj <bucket_name> to create a bucket. Your bucket name must be unique. You can enter lsobj -l to see the existing buckets.Copy all the required files to the bucket: cpobj [source_directory]/file_name <bucket_name>:. For example, cpobj /fs/www-users/jayid-test/index.html jayid-test:Create a web configuration for your bucket:  webobj -m create -c website --index=index.html --error=error.html <bucket_name>Make your bucket public: chobj -m public <bucket_name>Third Method (Using a Graphical S3 Client):Since there are many different graphical clients available, we won't be able to cover detailed instructions for all of them. The instruction below only applies to Cyberduck.Please refer to S3Clients to download and install Cyberduck.Log into Cyberduck using the instruction from the previous step.Once logged in, right-click > New Folder.... Give a unique name to your bucket.Right-click on the bucket you just created, and click on Upload.... You can upload multiple files at once.Once all the files are uploaded, right-click on the same bucket, and click on info.Under the Distribution (CDN) tab make sure to leave a checkmark next to Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.Next, click on the drop-down menu next to Index File and select your index.html file (or whatever file you're using as your index file).Under the Permission tab, add a permission by clicking on the cog icon on the bottom left and click on Everyone. Change the permission for Everyone to READ as shown on the image below.<Section: Accessing the WebsiteYou can access the website by using the default URL which has the form https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io.Section: Setting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpageIf you are intending to use the site as your personal UMIACS webpage, once the bucket is configured and all the required files are uploaded, please log into your UMIACS Directory page (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory/info/)  and update the Home Page attribute to https://<Bucket_name>.umiacs.io. Replace <Bucket_name> with the name of the bucket you created.Afterwards, www.umiacs.umd.edu/~username will also redirect to your website.Section: Disabling a WebsiteIf you no longer wish to host a website, you can disable the bucket's web configuration.Using the web interface:Click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and then click on Bucket Settings.On the settings page you can, click on Remove Website Configuration. Alternatively, you can also click on the Make Private button to make your bucket private and remove any associated web configuration.Using the CLI:Enter the following command in the terminal: webobj -m delete -c website <bucket_name>Using a Graphical S3 Client (Cyberduck):Right-click on the bucket where you are hosting your website and click info.Click on the Distribution (CDN) tab and uncheck the box Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.Section: MiscMore commands for umobj (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md%7C) S3ClientsRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=OBJ/WebHosting&oldid=10661"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/WindowsPython has the title Section: WindowsPython and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchPython can be user installed.Below are installation instructions for both .exe and MSI installers.

This is important as UMIACS runs many multi-tenant hosts (such as Nexus) and doesn't provide administrative control to users on them.  While Docker (https://www.docker.com)  is popular, the most typical setups require a daemon that has administrative level privileges that makes it not tenable.Apptainer was previously branded as Singularity.  You should still be able to run commands on the system with singularity, however you should start migrating to using the apptainer command.Section: Contents1 Overview2 Nexus Containers2.1 Bind Mounts2.2 Shared Containers3 Docker Workflow ExampleSection: OverviewYou can find out what the current version is that we provide by running the apptainer --version command.

To create images from definition files, you need to have administrative rights. You will need to either use Podman to accomplish this on UMIACS-supported hosts, or alternatively do this on a host that you have full administrative access to (laptop or personal desktop) rather than a UMIACS-supported host.If you are going to pull large images, you may run out of space in your home directory.

It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.Section: Project DirectoriesYou can request project based allocations for up to 8TB and up to 180 days with approval from a GAMMA faculty member.  To request an allocation, please  contact staff with the faculty member(s) that approved the project in the conversation.  Please include the following details:Project Name (short)DescriptionSize (1TB, 2TB, etc.)Length in days (30 days, 90 days, etc.)Other user(s) that need to access the allocation, if anyThese allocations will be available from /fs/gamma-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation (requires re-approval from a GAMMA faculty member).If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.This data is backed up nightly.Section: Scratch DirectoriesScratch data has no data protection, there are no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories:Network scratch directoryLocal scratch directoriesSection: Network Scratch DirectoryYou are allocated 100GB of scratch space via NFS from /gammascratch/$username.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.This directory is automounted so you may not see your directory if you run ls /gammascratch but it will be mounted when you cd into your /gammascratch directory.You may request a permanent increase of up to 200GB total space without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  If you need space beyond 200GB, you will need faculty approval. This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.Section: Local Scratch DirectoriesThese file systems are not available over NFS and there are no backups or snapshots available for these file systems.Each computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These directories are local to each node, ie. the /scratch0 on two different nodes are completely separate.These directories are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage data to these directories within the confines of your jobs and stage the data out before the end of your jobs.These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month during our monthly maintenance windows.  Again, please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.Gamma has invested in a 20TB NVMe scratch file system on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu that is available as /scratch1.  To utilize this space, you will need to copy data from/to this over SSH from a compute node.  To make this easier, you may want to setup SSH keys that will allow you to copy data without prompting for passwords.The /scratch1 directory on nexusgamma00.umiacs.umd.edu doesn't have a tmpwatch. The files in this directory need to be manually removed once they are no longer needed.Section: DatasetsWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/gamma-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.The list of GAMMA datasets we currently host can be viewed here (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=GAMMA) .Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus/GAMMA&oldid=11906"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/FTP/macOS/Finder has the title Section: FTP/macOS/Finder and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchFTP services can be accessed from supported machines running macOS.

The motivation behind this is to provide publicly accessible datasets in a well-defined location in order to de-duplicate their use elsewhere, thus reducing overall storage usage.Section: Dataset Directories CML (/fs/cml-datasets)List of datasets (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=CML)  -- faculty approver Tom Goldstein GAMMA (/fs/gamma-datasets)List of datasets (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=GAMMA)  -- faculty approver Dinesh ManochaNexus (/fs/nexus-datasets)List of datasets (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Nexus)  Vulcan (/fs/vulcan-datasets)List of datasets (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Vulcan)  -- faculty approver Abhinav ShrivastavaSection: Requesting a new datasetYou can request a new dataset by  contacting staff with a link to the dataset's official download location. Mirrors and torrents/other peer-to-peer re-hosting are not allowed unless sanctioned by the dataset owners. CML/GAMMA/Vulcan: If the uncompressed/final dataset size is over 100GB, staff will first contact the faculty approver for the cluster to ensure they approve of using the storage space. If the size is under 100GB, no faculty approval is required. Staff will then inspect the dataset and see if there are any terms and conditions that must be agreed to before downloading.Nexus: Please let staff know which faculty member's research you are working on that requires use of the dataset you are requesting. Then, if the uncompressed/final dataset size is over 50GB, the Director of Computing Facilities (https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/people/computing-staff)  must first approve of using the storage space. If the size is under 50GB, no approval is required. Staff will then inspect the dataset and see if there are any terms and conditions that must be agreed to before downloading.If there are no terms and conditions, staff will download/extract the dataset, copy it to the appropriate location depending on what cluster you are requesting it for, and let you know when it is available for use on that cluster.If there are terms and conditions in excess of well-defined Creative Commons licenses (https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) , staff will first need to have the dataset's terms and conditions approved by UMD's Office of Research Administration (ORA) (https://ora.umd.edu/) . Since the dataset will be hosted by UMIACS, as an institution, in a location accessible by all users of a cluster, not all of whom will have individually agreed to the terms and conditions, having a single person, staff member or not, agree to a set of terms and conditions is not sufficient to host it. After approval by ORA, staff will perform the same steps as mentioned above (download/extract, copy to appropriate location, and let you know when ready).Section: Dataset useAll datasets are read-only to users. Any intermediate data generated from a dataset will need to be stored in a location other than the shared filesystem hosting the dataset and other datasets.Exceptions may be granted if there is a set of intermediate data generated from a dataset that you believe will be useful to a subset of a cluster's users. If you suspect this is the case for some of your generated data, please  contact staff. We will follow the above procedure and upon whatever approvals may be necessary, copy the intermediate data into the shared filesystem.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Datasets&oldid=11587"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/BarracudaSpamFirewall has the title Section: BarracudaSpamFirewall and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Introduction2 Mail Flow Through Barracudas3 Scoring4 Quarantine5 Quarantine Passthrough6 Whitelists, Blacklists & Bayesian Filtering7 More InformationSection: IntroductionUMIACS has deployed a system with 2 Barracuda Networks spam firewalls.

Subsequently you will receive every day (unless you configure otherwise) a mail at approx. 3:30pm EST from the Barracuda with your quarantine summary. Please note that auto log-in through the link provided in the summary does not work due to a recent firmware upgrade on the Barracudas. Please use the links provided above to log in.Section: ScoringThe Barracudas will score every message that passes through them and inject varying message headers based on that score.  You can then create email filters based on these headers to filter out messages that are tagged as spam by the Barracudas. See BarracudaSpamFirewall/Scoring for more details.Section: QuarantineMail that has been deemed as spam will be kept on the Barracudas in quarantine.  It will not be delivered to your mailbox unless you configure the Barracudas to do so.Your quarantine will be preserved for 21 days. If mail is held for longer, then it will be purged.If you receive a security warning in your browser after clicking this link, you may need to add the UMIACS Certificate AuthorityYou can search your spam quarantine with the following steps BarracudaSpamFirewall/SearchingQuarantineSection: Quarantine PassthroughIf you wish to have the mail that would ordinarily be quarantined by Barracuda delivered to your mailbox instead you can configure this using the Barracuda web configuration.You can enable this functionality with the following guide BarracudaSpamFirewall/QuarantinePassthroughSection: NoneYou may also setup whitelists, blacklists, and Bayesian filtering options through the Preferences tab at the top of the Barracuda web portal.Section: More InformationFor more information on how to use the Barracuda please download the user's guide:https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/images/5/5a/Barracuda_usersguide.pdf (https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/images/5/5a/Barracuda_usersguide.pdf) Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=BarracudaSpamFirewall&oldid=10019"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/HelpDesk has the title Section: HelpDesk and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThe UMIACS Help Desk provides Technical Support and Equipment Procurement.Help Desk LocationBrendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering Room 31098125 Paint Branch DriveCollege Park, MD 20742Help Desk Hours9:00am - 5:00pm Monday - Friday (excluding University Holidays (https://phr-app6.umd.edu/holidays/) )Section: How to Contact StaffEmailstaff@umiacs.umd.edu (mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu)  for technical supportorders@umiacs.umd.edu (mailto:orders@umiacs.umd.edu)  for equipment procurementfacilities@umiacs.umd.edu (mailto:facilities@umiacs.umd.edu)  for room access requests and building-related inquiriesTelephone(301) 405-1775 (tel:+13014051775)  JIRA Request TrackerRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=HelpDesk&oldid=12050"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Iribe/ConferenceRooms/List has the title Section: Iribe/ConferenceRooms/List and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchBelow is a list of all the Iribe ConferenceRooms that are scheduled with a UMD Google Room Resource Calendar.

This may take a minute or two to complete.Once done, you can start using the printer.Section: TroubleshootingIf you receive the following error when attempting to add a printer queue, the issue may be that your computer is configured for a higher level of printer security than is default at UMIACS as a result of the PrintNightmare vulnerability (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrintNightmare) .To resolve this error:Click on the Start menu and type "cmd" in the run bar.Right-Click on the cmd button, and select "Run as Administrator" - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!Select "Yes" when it asks if you want to allow the following program to make changes.From the Command Prompt, run these commands in order:reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint" /v RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /freg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print" /v RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /fnet stop spooler /y && net start spoolerAttempt to add the printer queue again.Section: Removing a printer queueTo remove a printer queue, open the Start menu and search for and go to Control Panel. Next, click on "View devices and printers." To remove the queue, right click on the printer and select "Remove device". If you wish to add the printer back, follow the instructions above.Section: Duplex PrintingMany printers in UMIACS support duplex (2 sided) printing. To make the duplex printing default, first make sure the appropriate printer queue is installed via the directions above. Afterwards, go to start, then “Devices and Printers.”Once the printer has been installed proceed by right clicking on the queue then selecting “Printing preferences.”After a few seconds the following menu will come up. Make sure you are on the “Printing Shortcuts” tab and select the “EcoSMART Settings” option then click on okay. This modification will allow you to print 2-sided whenever you choose to use this printer.Section: Store and Print PIN-Protected JobsPIN-protected jobs provide a way to ensure jobs are not printed until you are ready to pick them up. This can be useful if you have a sensitive job that you want to print on a public printer at UMIACS. Follow the below steps to store a job and then print it at the printer.Create a stored jobFrom the software program, select the Print option.Select the printer from the list of printers, and then select Properties or Preferences (name varies by software program)Click the Job Storage tab.Under Job Storage Mode, select Personal Job.In the drop-down menu under Make Job Private/Secure, select PIN to print, and type in a 4-digit number.Note: You will need to provide the entered PIN (4-digit number) at the printer's control panel.Click the OK button to close the Document Properties/Preferences dialog box. In the Print dialog box, click Print.Print a stored jobAfter you have created a stored job using the instructions above, follow these steps to print from the printer's control panel.From the Home screen on the printer control panel, select Print.Select Print from Job Storage.Select Choose, and then select the name of the folder where the job is stored.Select the name of the job, enter your chosen PIN (4-digit number), and click Ok.Select Print to print the job.Note: The print job is deleted from memory after it prints.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=WindowsPrinting&oldid=11726"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Creating_service_admin_user_on_macOS has the title Section: Creating service admin user on macOS and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchWhen taking an Apple product to the Terrapin Tech store (https://it.umd.edu/terrapin-tech) , it is critical that you create a Service Admin User on your computer before having it serviced. The technicians at the store require an admin user name and password, and if the pre-existing password is the same as your UMIACS domain login password, revealing it to the technicians would represent a security vulnerability. To remedy this, you must create a new temporary user account with administrator privileges that the technicians can use to service your machine. Section: Creating the new accountMake sure you are logged in to an administrator account on your MacBook.Navigate to System Preferences. (Click on the Apple Logo at the top lefthand side of the screen, and select "System Preferences" from the dropdown menu.)From the System Preferences menu, select "Users and Groups" .On the righthand side of the screen where it lists the users currently on the machine, click on the 'Add User' button.By default, the new account will be set to a Standard account. Select the "New User" dropdown menu and choose "Administrator" from the list.The new user's full name should be "Service Admin," and the account name should be "serviceadmin".The password is up to you, so long as it's not the same as your UMIACS account password or your UMD Directory ID password.Select "Create User".When prompted by the Terrapin Tech sore, you should give this account's credentials to the technician, not your UMIACS account credentials.

The umask is represented similarly as three digits, each representing a 3 bits. For each bit that is set to 1 in the umask the corresponding bit of any files or directories that are created is set to 0. In binary operations it is equivelent to bitwise negating the umask and then doing a bitwise and on that negation and the default for the object being created. The three popular umasks are 022, 002 and 007.Section: Contents1 umask 0222 umask 0023 umask 0074 umask 0005 Setting umaskSection: umask 022This as the example shows above that you will get full rwx for the user, r-x for the group and r-x for other.  This is the default in almost all of our operating systems.        777  111 111 111  umask 022  000 010 010         = 755  111 101 101Section: umask 002This would give full rwx for the user, full rwx for the group and give only r-x for other.  This is helpful when you want your default group (or a SetGID directory) to have full control over the files and directories you create while allowing everyone else read and execute permissions.        777  111 111 111  umask 002  000 000 010         = 775  111 111 101Section: umask 007This will give the user and group full rwx permissions and give other no permissions.        777  111 111 111  umask 007  000 000 111         = 770  111 111 000Section: umask 000Please never use this umask as it will give full control to user, group and other.   In other words it makes the directory or file world read, write and executable and can be a large security risk to you and your colleagues.Section: Setting umaskYour umask is tied to your current shell and can be set with the shell builtin command umask. If issued without an argument the umask will return the current umask, occasionally omitting any leading zeros. To set a umask issue the umask command with umask you want to use.[gnorts:~] username% umask 022[gnorts:~] username% umask 002[gnorts:~] username% umask002However most of the time, you find yourself in a work environment where the same umask is what you want to use all the time, and you don't want to have to think about it. In that you case you want to set your umask in your shell initialization file. For bash the initialization file is .profile or .bash_profile and for tcsh the initialization files is .cshrc or .tcshrc. These files behave mostly like scripts and the umask command can be entered without any additional syntax as seen in the example bellow: [username@nexuscfar01 ~]$ cat .cshrc  setenv EDITOR vim umask 002Or for example if you use Bash you can run this command. echo 'umask 002' >> ~/.bash_profileRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Umask&oldid=11013"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Nexus/Vulcan has the title Section: Nexus/Vulcan and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchThe compute nodes from Vulcan's previous standalone cluster have folded into Nexus as of the scheduled  maintenance window for August 2023 (Thursday 08/17/2023, 5-8pm).The Nexus cluster already has a large pool of compute resources made possible through college-level funding for UMIACS and CSD faculty.

The actual submission hosts are:nexusvulcan00.umiacs.umd.edunexusvulcan01.umiacs.umd.eduAll partitions, QoSes, and account names from the standalone Vulcan cluster have been moved over to Nexus. However, please note that vulcan- is prepended to all of the values that were present in the standalone Vulcan cluster to distinguish them from existing values in Nexus. The lone exception is the base account that was named vulcan in the standalone cluster (it is also named just vulcan in Nexus).Here are some before/after examples of job submission with various parameters:Standalone Vulcan cluster submission commandNexus cluster submission commandsrun --partition=dpart --qos=medium --account=abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bashsrun --partition=vulcan-dpart --qos=vulcan-medium --account=vulcan-abhinav --gres=gpu:gtx1080ti:2 --pty bashsrun --partition=cpu --qos=cpu --pty bashsrun --partition=vulcan-cpu --qos=vulcan-cpu --account=vulcan --pty bashsrun --partition=scavenger --qos=scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bashsrun --partition=vulcan-scavenger --qos=vulcan-scavenger --account=vulcan --gres=gpu:4 --pty bashVulcan users (exclusively) can schedule non-interruptible jobs on Vulcan nodes with any non-scavenger job parameters. Please note that the vulcan-dpart partition has a GrpTRES limit of 100% of the available cores/RAM on all vulcan## in aggregate nodes plus 50% of the available cores/RAM on legacy## nodes in aggregate, so your job may need to wait if all available cores/RAM (or GPUs) are in use. It also has a max submission limit of 500 jobs per user simultaneously so as to not overload the cluster. This is codified by the partition QoS named vulcan.Please note that the Vulcan compute nodes are also in the institute-wide scavenger partition in Nexus. Vulcan users still have scavenging priority over these nodes via the vulcan-scavenger partition (i.e., all vulcan- partition jobs (other than vulcan-scavenger) can preempt both vulcan-scavenger and scavenger partition jobs, and vulcan-scavenger partition jobs can preempt scavenger partition jobs).Section: NodesThere are currently 46  GPU nodes available running a mixture of NVIDIA RTX A6000, NVIDIA RTX A5000, NVIDIA RTX A4000, NVIDIA Quadro P6000, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, and NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards. There are also 4 CPU-only nodes available.All nodes are scheduled with the SLURM resource manager.Section: PartitionsThere are three partitions available to general Vulcan SLURM users.  You must specify a partition when submitting your job.vulcan-dpart - This is the default partition. Job allocations are guaranteed. Only nodes with GPUs from architectures before NVIDIA's Ampere architecture (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)  are included in this partition.vulcan-scavenger - This is the alternate partition that allows jobs longer run times and more resources but is preemptable when jobs in other vulcan- partitions are ready to be scheduled.vulcan-cpu - This partition is for CPU focused jobs. Job allocations are guaranteed.There are a few additional partitions available to subsets of Vulcan users based on specific requirements.vulcan-ampere - This partition contains nodes with GPUs from NVIDIA's Ampere architecture (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/) . Job allocations are guaranteed.As of Thursday 02/29/2024 at 12pm, there is a 4 hour time limit on interactive jobs in this partition. If you need to run longer jobs, you will need to modify your workflow into a job that can be submitted as a batch script.As of Thursday 03/21/2024 at 5pm, there is a limit of 4 CPUs and 48G memory maximum per GPU requested by a job. If you need to run jobs with more CPUs/memory, you will either need to request more GPUs in the job or use a different partition.Submission is restricted to the Slurm  accounts of the faculty who invested in these nodes:Abhinav Shrivastava (vulcan-abhinav)Jia-Bin Huang (vulcan-jbhuang)Christopher Metzler (vulcan-metzler)Matthias Zwicker (vulcan-zwicker)Section: AccountsVulcan has a base SLURM account vulcan which has a modest number of guaranteed billing resources available to all cluster users at any given time.  Other faculty that have invested in Vulcan compute infrastructure have an additional account provided to their sponsored accounts on the cluster.If you do not specify an account when submitting your job, you will receive the vulcan account.

Please also review UMIACS  Local Data Storage policies including any volume that is labeled as scratch.Vulcan users can also request  Nexus project allocations.Section: Home DirectoriesYou have 30GB of home directory storage available at /nfshomes/<username>.  It has both Snapshots and  Backups enabled.Home directories are intended to store personal or configuration files only.  We encourage you to not share any data in your home directory.  You are encouraged to utilize our GitLab infrastructure to host your code repositories.NOTE: To check your quota on this directory, use the command df -h ~.Section: Scratch DirectoriesScratch data has no data protection including no snapshots and the data is not backed up. There are two types of scratch directories in the Vulcan compute infrastructure:Network scratch directoryLocal scratch directoriesSection: Network Scratch DirectoryYou have 300GB of scratch storage available at /vulcanscratch/<username>.  It is not backed up or protected in any way.  This directory is automounted so you will need to cd into the directory or request/specify a fully qualified file path to access this.You may request a temporary increase of up to 500GB total space for a maximum of 120 days without any faculty approval by  contacting staff.  Once the temporary increase period is over, you will be contacted and given a one-week window of opportunity to clean and secure your data before staff will forcibly remove data to get your space back under 300GB.  If you need space beyond 500GB or for longer than 120 days, you will need faculty approval and/or a project directory.This file system is available on all submission, data management, and computational nodes within the cluster.Section: Local Scratch DirectoriesEach computational node that you can schedule compute jobs on has one or more local scratch directories.  These are always named /scratch0, /scratch1, etc.  These are almost always more performant than any other storage available to the job.  However, you must stage their data within the confine of their job and stage the data out before the end of their job.These local scratch directories have a tmpwatch job which will delete unaccessed data after 90 days, scheduled via maintenance jobs to run once a month at 1am.  Different nodes will run the maintenance jobs on different days of the month to ensure the cluster is still highly available at all times.  Please make sure you secure any data you write to these directories at the end of your job.Section: DatasetsWe have read-only dataset storage available at /fs/vulcan-datasets.  If there are datasets that you would like to see curated and available, please see  this page.The list of Vulcan datasets we currently host can be viewed here (https://info.umiacs.umd.edu/datasets/list/?q=Vulcan) .Section: Project StorageUsers within the Vulcan compute infrastructure can request project based allocations for up to 10TB for up to 180 days by  contacting staff with approval from the Vulcan faculty manager (Dr. Shrivastava).  These allocations will be available from /fs/vulcan-projects and /fs/cfar-projects under a name that you provide when you request the allocation.  Near the end of the allocation period, staff will contact you and ask if you would like to renew the allocation for up to another 180 days (requires re-approval from Dr. Shrivastava).If you are no longer in need of the storage allocation, you will need to relocate all desired data within two weeks of the end of the allocation period.  Staff will then remove the allocation.If you do not respond to staff's request by the end of the allocation period, staff will make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If you do respond asking for renewal but the original faculty approver does not respond within two weeks of the end of the allocation period, staff will also make the allocation temporarily inaccessible.If one month from the end of the allocation period is reached without both you and the faculty approver responding, staff will remove the allocation.Project storage is fully protected.  It has  snapshots enabled and is  backed up nightly.Section: Object StorageAll Vulcan users can request project allocations in the UMIACS Object Store (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/help) . Please  contact staff with a short project name and the amount of storage you will need to get started.To access this storage, you'll need to use a  S3 client or our UMobj command line utilities.An example on how to use the umobj command line utilities can be found  here.  A full set of documentation for the utilities can be found on the umobj Gitlab page (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj) .Section: MigrationSection: Home DirectoriesThe Nexus uses NFShomes home directories - if your UMIACS account was created before February 22nd, 2023, you were using /cfarhomes/<username> as your home directory on the standalone Vulcan cluster. While /cfarhomes is available on Nexus, your shell initialization scripts from it will not automatically load. Please copy over anything you need to your /nfshomes/<username> directory at your earliest convenience, as /cfarhomes will be retired in a two phase process:Fri 11/17/2023, 5pm: cfarhomes directories are made read-onlyThu 12/21/2023, 5-8pm (monthly maintenance window): cfarhomes directories are taken offlineRetrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Nexus/Vulcan&oldid=12037"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Stow has the title Section: Stow and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchGNU Stow - http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/ (http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Stow&oldid=3966"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/ContentManagement has the title Section: ContentManagement and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: IntroductionUMIACS supports a web content management system that allows faculty members to add modify their user profile on the UMIACS website: https://www.umiacs.umd.edu (https://www.umiacs.umd.edu) .Section: Logging inYou may log into the content management system at https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/user (https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/user)  with your UMIACS username/password.

It is simple to set up and highly customizable. At UMIACS, it is the software we recommend to users looking to either record or stream on either their personal computers or in a conference room or auditorium setting.Section: Conference Quick SetupBelow are steps outlining how to start recording or streaming your meetings. If, at any point, you have questions or need other assistance, feel free to reach out to the  UMIACS Help Desk. Select the source you'd like to route to the computer via the "Shared Media" option on the Crestron control panel. This will route the source through the A/V Bridge to the conference room computer.Download (windows zip file) (https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases)  and/or launch OBS on the conference room computer and do not run the auto-configuration wizard.Set up video.Click the + under the Sources pane at the bottom and select Video Capture Device. Leave everything at default and hit OK.Ensure the proper device is selected to get the video to show up. In larger conference rooms and auditoriums with an A/V cabinet, this will usually be called 'AV Bridge'.Click OK and resize the window to take up the entirety of the canvas.If the output appears blurry or fuzzy, try setting the Resolution/FPS Type to Custom by right clicking the source -> Properties and changing it from Device Default. This seems to be particularly important in the larger conference rooms and auditoriums, as the A/V stack's default resolution is not the highest supported one (720p). Change resolution to the highest available one. You probably want to leave FPS at Match Output FPS.Ensure audio settings look OK.The default microphone for the system should already be set up to record audio. It is listed as Mic/Aux under the Mixer pane at the bottom. If you want to use an alternate microphone, click on the cog -> Properties and change the device.Keep in mind that by default, Desktop Audio is recorded as well. If the user running the conference expects to play media during the conference that they do not want being picked up in the stream or recording itself, click the megaphone icon under Desktop Audio by default to mute it.Set up either streaming, recording, or both as follows.Streaming:Go to File -> Settings -> Stream and select the service you want to use (99% of the time probably YouTube or Twitch).Locate your stream key for the account you want to use. For YouTube/Twitch, there is a helpful link right there that takes you to the proper place to get this.YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard (https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard) , near the bottomTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings (https://www.twitch.tv/username/dashboard/settings) , at the top (replace username with your username). You can also link your account directly if you want.Enter your key and hit OK.Click Start Streaming under the Control pane at the bottom.Recording:Go to File -> Settings -> Output and change the recording path to something appropriate and click OK. If in a conference room, this should be an external SSD or the internal drive. We have observed that using external HDDs may introduce dropped frames due to encoding lag because of I/O bottlenecks.Click Start Recording under the Control pane at the bottom.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=ConferenceRooms/Recording&oldid=10082"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/RHEL7 has the title Section: RHEL7 and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchRed Hat Enterprise Linux (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux)  7 is an operating system published by Red Hat, Inc., which is currently a subsidiary of IBM.Section: Contents1 Features2 Kernel and Performance3 Virtualization4 File System Capabilities5 SecuritySection: FeaturesA summary of important improvements are listed below.Section: Kernel and PerformanceBased on Linux 3.10.0-957 kernel.Initial process is changed to systemd.Includes Security-Enhanced Linux (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux) .Section: VirtualizationUsers can run virtual machines within RHEL 7 using its built-in Kernel-based Virtual Machine (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_getting_started_guide/chap-virtualization_getting_started-products) , or KVM.

They are typically released annually by Microsoft.At UMIACS, we release these feature updates to be installed on all UMIACS-supported Windows desktops as well as Enterprise supported laptops and home machines via our Windows Patch Management. We typically release feature updates to be installed several months after Microsoft releases them to the general public to ensure that the targeted release is compatible with all software that we run, such as our VPN.Section: Current Feature Release at UMIACSThe current feature releases we deploy at UMIACS are:OS VersionFeature ReleaseWindows 1022H2Windows 1123H2We deployed the current Windows 10 feature release on March 15th, 2023 and the current Windows 11 feature release on April 10th, 2024.The current Windows 10 feature release is the final one being released by Microsoft.

Please see that page for an example of what the process looks like.Please note that feature updates often have supplemental updates (i.e. security patches) that must install after the feature update itself. This means that in addition to the reboot issued as part of the feature update install process, additional reboots may be required while installing the supplemental updates thereafter. This is by design.

On the settings page for each bucket, there is a section allowing you to specify a configuration for a website hosted in your bucket. You can choose keys located in your bucket to act as the index file (what will be displayed when someone visits your website) and the error file (what will be displayed when an error is encountered loading your website). These settings can be updated at any time.Because hosting a website through your bucket requires others to have access to any keys associated with your website, setting up a website configuration will automatically set the visibility of your bucket to public and remove the bucket level ACLs. You will not be able to set the bucket back to private without first removing the website configuration, which can be done on the bucket settings page.Note: The Object Store only has the capability to support static content and client-side scripting in bucket websites.Section: Contents1 Hosting a Website2 Accessing the Website3 Setting a Website as your personal UMIACS webpage4 Disabling a Website5 MiscSection: Hosting a WebsiteHosting a website in OBJ is quite easy and can be done in a few simple steps. There are three different ways you can set up your OBJ bucket to host a static website.First Method (Using the Web Interface):Log into OBJ (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/)  and create a bucket. Make sure to choose a bucket name carefully since this will be part of the web URL. Upload your index.html file and optional error.html file (and any other required files for your website) on the bucket that you just created.Once the files are uploaded, click on Bucket SettingsOn the settings page, click on the blue Make Public button. Under Website Hosting, enter the name of your index.html (and optionally error.html) file and hit Submit.Second Method (Using the UMobj CLI):Set up your environment variables.On the shell enter mkobj <bucket_name> to create a bucket. Your bucket name must be unique. You can enter lsobj -l to see the existing buckets.Copy all the required files to the bucket: cpobj [source_directory]/file_name <bucket_name>:. For example, cpobj /fs/www-users/jayid-test/index.html jayid-test:Create a web configuration for your bucket:  webobj -m create -c website --index=index.html --error=error.html <bucket_name>Make your bucket public: chobj -m public <bucket_name>Third Method (Using a Graphical S3 Client):Since there are many different graphical clients available, we won't be able to cover detailed instructions for all of them. The instruction below only applies to Cyberduck.Please refer to S3Clients to download and install Cyberduck.Log into Cyberduck using the instruction from the previous step.Once logged in, right-click > New Folder.... Give a unique name to your bucket.Right-click on the bucket you just created, and click on Upload.... You can upload multiple files at once.Once all the files are uploaded, right-click on the same bucket, and click on info.Under the Distribution (CDN) tab make sure to leave a checkmark next to Enable Website Configuration (HTTP) Distribution.Next, click on the drop-down menu next to Index File and select your index.html file (or whatever file you're using as your index file).Under the Permission tab, add a permission by clicking on the cog icon on the bottom left and click on Everyone.

They include the programs 'lpr', 'lprm', 'lpq', and 'lpstat'.All of the UNIX queues are configured to handle postscript. See the examples section for more information on how to print different file types.Basic CommandsSection: lprUse `lpr -Pprintername filename.ps` to submit the postscript file named filename.ps to the printer queue named printername. If no filename is specified, lpr reads from standard input. If no printer name is specified, then the job is discarded by the print server.Additional options to specify media handling, page orientation, and double sided printing can be passed to the print spooler using one or more -Z options. Double sided printing is specified with -Zduplex. Page orientation is controlled with -Zportrait, -Zlandscape. Manual feed media (eg. transparencies) is specified with -Zmanual. Please note that not all printers support all -Z options.Section: nscriptUse `nscript -Pprintername filename.txt` to send the text file named filename.txt to the printer named printername. If no filename is specified, then nscript reads from standard input.Nscript is a weak attempt to simulate Adobe Systems Incorporated nscript programs. It supports a handful of interesting arguments. With the '-G' argument, nscript generates gaudy output that includes header information on each page. The '-2' argument generates two column output and '-r' rotates the job's orientation to landscape mode.Section: lprmUse 'lprm -Pprintername' to remove jobs from the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it removes the first removable job in the queue. Given a job's id as an argument, it will remove the specified job from the queue and you can remove all removable jobs from a queue with the argument "all".You are able to remove items from the queue that you have submitted from anywhere, not just the computer from which the job was submitted.Section: lpqUse 'lpq -Pprintername' to get the status of the queue named printername. With no further arguments, it will print the printer queue, the host queried, and the number of jobs in the queue. With the -l argument, it will specify the id, queue rank, the total size of the job in bytes, and any errors encountered in processing the job.Section: Generate PostscriptPostscript is a Page Description Language that is understood by high quality printers and typically generated by applications. There is a lot of documentation about using and programming in postscript, but for our purposes you'll just need to generate postscript from an existing text file.You can generate postscript from an existing text file with textps. For example, to convert the Message of the Day file to a postscript file try `textps ... > file.ps`.Section: Preview your jobIt's helpful to preview your postscript files before printing by calling Ghostview with `ghostview file.ps`.Higher quality previewing is available using Ghostview's derivativegv. You can call it as `gv file.ps`.Both commands should open a window that displays the contents of your postscript file.Section: Choose a print queuePrint queues are described here:  Print Queues.You can check list all the print queues with `lpq -a` and you can list just a single queue `lpq -Pprintername` -- eg. ps432-3208 with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.Section: Send a print jobAfter you choose a suitable printer (eg. ps432-3208), you can send your postscript file to the printer with `lpr -Pps432-3208 file.ps`.Section: Monitor a print jobYou can monitor the job you sent to the printer (eg. ps432-3208) with `lpq -Pps432-3208`.Lpq will return the following output:[herzog 33] lpq -Pps432-3208Printer: ps432-3208@lpr1 (dest raw@ps432-3208.umiacs.umd.edu) 'HP M653 in IRB 3208'Queue: 2 printable jobsServer: pid 11833 activeUnspooler: pid 11837 activeStatus: waiting for subserver to exit at 14:50:45.141Rank   Owner/ID                  Class Job Files                 Size Timeactive username@herzog+198           A   198 file.ps               4309 14:50:442      username2@prime+199           A   199 hpss.ps               4309 14:50:45Active connection from  128.8.120.247Waiting connection from 128.8.120.247Section: Remove a Print JobIf you would like to remove your job from the queue, you should get the job's id from the output of `lpq`. You can remove it with `lprm -Pps432-3208 198`From the output of lpq, I can see that the job id is 198 and I can remove it with lprm as follows:[herzog 35] lprm -Pps432-3208 198Printer ps432-3208@durer:checking perms 'username@herzog+198'dequeued 'username@herzog+198'Often the last job listed in the printer queue has already spooled to the printer, and lprm will be unable to delete the job.  In this case, the only way to cancel the job will be to press the 'cancel' button on the printer.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=UNIXPrinting&oldid=9829"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/CUDA has the title Section: CUDA and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchCUDA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA)  is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA.

We aim to provide 90 days of coverage, at one backup per night. However, this coverage may not be perfect, as our backups are very coarse. Depending on the size of the change and size of the file, backups may be periodically missed. Furthermore, files that change often may not have all versions backed up to 90 days, and files which were created very recently may not be backed up.If you need anything from our nightly backups, please contact staff with the full path to the directory(s) which you would like to have restored.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=NightlyBackups&oldid=6247"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/MFA/Duo_Recovery has the title Section: MFA/Duo Recovery and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchIf you haven't already, download the Duo app on your device.Navigate to https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/directory) , click Login in the top right, and use your UMIACS credentials.At the Duo prompt, click the 'My Settings & Devices' button on the left.Select either the Call Me or Passcode option, which does not require the app to authenticate.Click Device Options on your registered device and then Reactivate Duo Mobile.

However, there are a number of cases where this is not feasible.Section: Contents1 Windows Local Storage2 UNIX Remote Storage3 UNIX Local Storage4 Locally Attached Storage5 Network Scratch Storage6 UNIX Storage CommandsSection: Windows Local StorageWindows hosts at UMIACS store user directories on their local C drives. Supported, UMIACS-managed hosts automatically back up user data on the C drive nightly using the Institute's backup system. If you have a supported, UMIACS-managed host that has other internal or external hard drives attached to it, or partitions other than C on its primary hard drive, please be aware that these drives/partitions are not backed up. Laptops and non-standard hosts are not automatically backed up and should be manually backed up by their users.Section: UNIX Remote StorageWe provide storage to each of our users in our UNIX offerings through the NFShomes.This home directory,   /nfshomes/usernameis backed up nightly into our TSM backup system.  This volume has Snapshots enabled for easy user restores.Users are given a 30GB Quota. This quota is non-expandable and you will need to use either local or other network storage for increased space.Section: UNIX Local StorageUNIX machines use redundant, backed-up network file shares for user directories.  Research data storage is also stored on redundant, backed-up network file shares and is generally available under /fs/All UNIX machines also have local storage available for transitory use.  These directories may be used to store temporary, local COPIES of data that is permanently stored elsewhere or as a staging point for output.These directories may not, under any circumstances, be used as permanent storage for unique, important data.  UMIACS staff cannot recover damaged or deleted data from these directories and will not be responsible for data loss if they are misused. Additionally, on our SLURM compute clusters, these volumes may have an automated cleanup routine that will delete unmodified data after some number of days. You can check the page for the specific cluster you are using for more information.Please note that /tmp in particular is at risk for data loss or corruption as that directory is regularly used by system processes and services for temporary storage.These directories include: - /tmp - /scratch0, /scratch1, ... (/scratch#) - any directory named in whole or in part "tmp", "temp", or "scratch".Section: Locally Attached StorageLocally attached storage like USB flash drives and USB hard drives are very popular.  However, these devices are significantly more vulnerable to data loss or theft than internal or networked data storage.  In general, UMIACS discourages the use of locally attached network storage when any other option is available.  Please note that these devices are prone to high rates of failure and additional steps should be taken to ensure that the data is backed up and that critical or confidential data is not lost or stolen.Section: Network Scratch StorageSome labs have network-attached storage dedicated for scratch/temporary storage. These shares are named in the same manner as local scratch or temporary storage (i.e. /fs/lab-scratch or /lab/scratch0) and are subject to the same policies as local scratch/tmp (discussed above.)Section: UNIX Storage CommandsBelow are a few different CLI commands that may prove useful for monitoring your storage usage and performance.

This provides a way to ensure security updates are installed and activated on the numerous different platforms and appliances that we maintain.The window for each month is calculated by adding 9 days to Microsoft's Patch Tuesday (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday)  to allow us to marshal patches released that month from Microsoft, Red Hat, Apple, and other OS and application vendors and have enough time to get our systems prepared to reboot.  This translates to the window being on the Thursday that occurs between the 17th and the 23rd (inclusive) of each month.  The window lasts from 5pm-8pm.Nexus will always have a reservation in place from 4:45pm-8pm on the day of the upcoming window to prevent jobs from being scheduled on compute nodes for the entirety of said window as well as 15 minutes before, to allow jobs to fully end. Any job submitted before the reservation begins that has a time limit that would run into the reservation will be held until at least the end of the reservation (8pm on the day of the window). This is to prevent issues with jobs failing to end properly causing delays in work we have scheduled during the window.A list of upcoming maintenance windows is as follows, with the next one in bold.

Public-facing hosts are hosts that are reachable via the Internet (e.g. via ping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) ) without first establishing a connection to our VPN. If you first connect to our VPN, you will not need to additionally multi-factor authenticate when using SSH. This is because our VPN already requires multi-factor authentication to establish a connection, and all subsequent SSH attempts after connecting to our VPN will pass through the tunnel created (already within the UMIACS border).SSH has two different authentication methods that we currently support on all of our internal hosts: interactive password authentication and  public key authentication. Multi-factor authentication-enabled SSH on our public-facing hosts only supports interactive password authentication, with the secondary factor coming from our Duo instance. We do not currently support public key based authentication and Duo multi-factor authentication on our public-facing hosts. Please note that unfortunately U2F (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor)  hardware tokens registered with Duo are not supported for SSH login specifically. Other hardware tokens such as a YubiKey (https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/)  or Duo's own hardware token (https://guide.duo.com/tokens)  will still work.Section: ExampleThe initial command or session setup for connecting to a host with multi-factor authentication enabled over SSH is the same as one that does not have it enabled. Our example for connecting to a host over SSH can be found  here. In the below example, we are also SSH-ing to a Nexus node e.g. ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduOnce you enter the command (if using a native terminal) or start the session (PuTTY or other terminal emulators), you will be presented with the following prompt:Password:Enter your UMIACS password here (the same as if you were using interactive password authentication to connect to an internal host). After correctly entering your password, you will be taken to the following prompt. Please note: The options shown here will vary depending on what/how many devices you have registered with our Duo instance. In this example, we have a mobile phone that has the Duo app installed, a tablet (iPad) that has the Duo app installed, a Duo hardware token, and a YubiKey all registered against our UMIACS Duo instance.Password:Duo two-factor login for usernameEnter a passcode or select one of the following options: 1.

As mentioned previously, you do not need an additional multi-factor authentication step when using SSH if you first connect to our VPN since it is already secured by multi-factor authentication.An alternative would be to use a terminal multiplexer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer)  such as Screen or Tmux to minimize the number of times you need to multi-factor authenticate. Terminal multiplexers allow you to start several different processes out of one terminal display, and also detach from and later reattach to each of the processes.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SecureShell/MFA&oldid=11513"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/GettingStarted has the title Section: GettingStarted and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 UMIACS Account Introduction2 Getting An Account3 Logging into your Account4 Account Maintenance5 Where's my data?6 Questions?Section: NoneUMIACS maintains several different systems and facilities.

Terminology3 Getting Started4 Buckets5 Keys (files)6 Hosting a Website in your Bucket7 Deleting Keys (files)8 Clients9 Access Key and Secret Key10 LabGroups11 Managing LabGroups12 Requesting a LabGroupSection: UMIACS Object StoreAn object store is a web-based storage solution focused on reliability, scalability and security. It is best suited for public content storage/distribution, archiving data or secure data sharing between users. Our Object Store can be used through the web interface (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj) , the command line UMobj utilities, third-party graphical  clients, and even programmatically using many popular programming languages.  We support a subset of the Amazon Simple Storage Services (S3) API (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html) , built around a technology called Ceph (http://ceph.com/) .Section: TerminologyS3-like storage thinks in terms of buckets and keys. Keys are analogous to files. A bucket is simply a container to a set of keys. There is no actual hierarchy inside of a bucket, but the standard UNIX path separator, a forward slash (/) at the end of a Key name, is interpreted by many clients (including this web site and our UMobj utilities) as being a directory delimiter. This allows you to copy data from your local filesystems to your buckets through umobj or third-party clients. You may specify who has what types of access to your buckets via Access Control Lists (ACLs) at the bucket level or the individual key level.Your data is protected from individual machine failure via replication within the cluster. All data is checksummed in accordance with the Amazon S3 protocol to ensure that data in transit is valid before it is accepted by the cluster. However, there are no backups or snapshots of this data in the cluster, so if a user deletes a key or bucket in the Object Store, there is no way to restore that information.Section: Getting StartedUMIACS users are allocated 50GB of storage.  Faculty are allocated 10TB. To get started, log in (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj)  and you will be redirected to the initial help page.  You can also find the link from our https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu)  site as "OBJbox Object Store".Section: BucketsYou can create and browse your buckets (containers that hold data) by visiting your buckets (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/)  page. You can also set bucket-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) from this page. Bucket-level ACLs get implicitly inherited to all the keys within the bucket. However, individual keys can have additional specific ACLs applied for more granular control.Bucket names must be unique. When you create a bucket it will notify you if the name is already taken.Section: NoneAfter selecting a bucket, you will be able to create folders and upload files within that bucket. Listed files can be downloaded, deleted, or assigned a specific ACL by the key owner/creator.Please note: Local file system ownership and permissions, and special files (such as symlinks) can not be represented in the Object Store. We highly suggest that if you are securing data into the Object Store and need these to be faithfully maintained that you use a local archive tool (tar, zip, etc..) to collect the data and then upload the resulting archive file(s).Section: Hosting a Website in your BucketPlease visit OBJ/WebHosting for more information.Section: NoneWithin the web interface you can delete files one-by-one. If you want to remove a bunch of files, you will need to use a different client as described below.This is dangerous as there are no backups of files in the Object Store. Be careful to only delete the data you intend to delete.Section: ClientsThere are several clients that can be used (sometimes with a limited set of features) on your desktop to gain access to the Object Store. All supported UMIACS systems running RHEL8 have a copy of our UMobj (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj)  utilities preinstalled which provide command line access to the Object Store. We also have an article in our wiki on  third party clients that lists and explains the details. These clients need to be configured with your Access and Secret Keys as described below.Section: Access Key and Secret KeyEach user has one or more pairs of Access Keys and Secret Keys that are used as a credential to not expose your password when using the Object Store. These can be obtained by clicking on your username (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/user/)  in the upper right-hand corner. You'll use these to identify and authenticate yourself to the Object Store.Please treat your Secret Key(s) the same as a password and do not plaintext it over email/otherwise or share it with any other individuals.When using the umobj (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj)  utilities, you will need to make sure you have added these credentials in your local shell initialization files. There are links to files that have these automatically generated for the 3 most popular UNIX shell families (bash/sh, csh/tcsh, and zsh). Please make sure that whatever file(s) you copy these credentials into can not be read by other users (eg. chmod 600 filename).Note: Each Access Key and Secret Key are specific to a particular object store, so if you are accessing multiple object stores you may want to write the credentials for each to separate files and then source each file when you want to use the associated object store. Please  contact staff if you have any questions.Section: LabGroupsLabGroups allow a group of users to share data while avoiding the need for complex ACLs by maintaining group ownership. Designated LabGroup managers can grant granular access (read, write, full control, manager) to buckets owned by the LabGroup. All objects owned by a LabGroup count against the group quota. LabGroups can be navigated using the menu with username in the top right corner of the page. Note: this will only appear if you are a member of at least one LabGroup. At this point, you can browse the Object Store as the LabGroup and obtain your unique Access Key and Secret Key pair using the instructions above. To switch to another LabGroup or back to your own buckets, click the menu again and select another user or group.Section: Managing LabGroupsLabGroups have many different levels of membership: Managers, FULL_CONTROL, READ/WRITE, and READ. Managers can add or remove LabGroup Members while every other access level cannot. If you hold the Manager role in a LabGroup, you can add and remove users using the Manage LabGroups (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/labgroup/list/)  page, which is available under the Manage menu at the top of the page. After selecting a LabGroup, you can add users by typing their username into the search field and selecting a membership role.Section: Requesting a LabGroupTo request a LabGroup for your project, please  contact staff.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=OBJ&oldid=11801"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/VPN/Windows has the title Section: Network/VPN/Windows and contains the following info: From UMIACS(Redirected from VPN/Windows)Jump to navigationJump to searchThe UMIACS VPN is accessible through the Ivanti Connect Secure Client.

It is best suited for public content storage/distribution, archiving data or secure data sharing between users. Our Object Store can be used through the web interface (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj) , the command line UMobj utilities, third-party graphical  clients, and even programmatically using many popular programming languages.  We support a subset of the Amazon Simple Storage Services (S3) API (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html) , built around a technology called Ceph (http://ceph.com/) .Section: TerminologyS3-like storage thinks in terms of buckets and keys. Keys are analogous to files. A bucket is simply a container to a set of keys. There is no actual hierarchy inside of a bucket, but the standard UNIX path separator, a forward slash (/) at the end of a Key name, is interpreted by many clients (including this web site and our UMobj utilities) as being a directory delimiter. This allows you to copy data from your local filesystems to your buckets through umobj or third-party clients. You may specify who has what types of access to your buckets via Access Control Lists (ACLs) at the bucket level or the individual key level.Your data is protected from individual machine failure via replication within the cluster. All data is checksummed in accordance with the Amazon S3 protocol to ensure that data in transit is valid before it is accepted by the cluster. However, there are no backups or snapshots of this data in the cluster, so if a user deletes a key or bucket in the Object Store, there is no way to restore that information.Section: Getting StartedUMIACS users are allocated 50GB of storage.  Faculty are allocated 10TB. To get started, log in (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj)  and you will be redirected to the initial help page.  You can also find the link from our https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu)  site as "OBJbox Object Store".Section: BucketsYou can create and browse your buckets (containers that hold data) by visiting your buckets (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/buckets/)  page. You can also set bucket-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) from this page. Bucket-level ACLs get implicitly inherited to all the keys within the bucket. However, individual keys can have additional specific ACLs applied for more granular control.Bucket names must be unique. When you create a bucket it will notify you if the name is already taken.Section: NoneAfter selecting a bucket, you will be able to create folders and upload files within that bucket. Listed files can be downloaded, deleted, or assigned a specific ACL by the key owner/creator.Please note: Local file system ownership and permissions, and special files (such as symlinks) can not be represented in the Object Store. We highly suggest that if you are securing data into the Object Store and need these to be faithfully maintained that you use a local archive tool (tar, zip, etc..) to collect the data and then upload the resulting archive file(s).Section: Hosting a Website in your BucketPlease visit OBJ/WebHosting for more information.Section: NoneWithin the web interface you can delete files one-by-one. If you want to remove a bunch of files, you will need to use a different client as described below.This is dangerous as there are no backups of files in the Object Store. Be careful to only delete the data you intend to delete.Section: ClientsThere are several clients that can be used (sometimes with a limited set of features) on your desktop to gain access to the Object Store. All supported UMIACS systems running RHEL8 have a copy of our UMobj (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj)  utilities preinstalled which provide command line access to the Object Store. We also have an article in our wiki on  third party clients that lists and explains the details. These clients need to be configured with your Access and Secret Keys as described below.Section: Access Key and Secret KeyEach user has one or more pairs of Access Keys and Secret Keys that are used as a credential to not expose your password when using the Object Store. These can be obtained by clicking on your username (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/user/)  in the upper right-hand corner. You'll use these to identify and authenticate yourself to the Object Store.Please treat your Secret Key(s) the same as a password and do not plaintext it over email/otherwise or share it with any other individuals.When using the umobj (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/umobj/blob/master/README.md#umobj)  utilities, you will need to make sure you have added these credentials in your local shell initialization files. There are links to files that have these automatically generated for the 3 most popular UNIX shell families (bash/sh, csh/tcsh, and zsh). Please make sure that whatever file(s) you copy these credentials into can not be read by other users (eg. chmod 600 filename).Note: Each Access Key and Secret Key are specific to a particular object store, so if you are accessing multiple object stores you may want to write the credentials for each to separate files and then source each file when you want to use the associated object store. Please  contact staff if you have any questions.Section: LabGroupsLabGroups allow a group of users to share data while avoiding the need for complex ACLs by maintaining group ownership. Designated LabGroup managers can grant granular access (read, write, full control, manager) to buckets owned by the LabGroup. All objects owned by a LabGroup count against the group quota. LabGroups can be navigated using the menu with username in the top right corner of the page. Note: this will only appear if you are a member of at least one LabGroup. At this point, you can browse the Object Store as the LabGroup and obtain your unique Access Key and Secret Key pair using the instructions above. To switch to another LabGroup or back to your own buckets, click the menu again and select another user or group.Section: Managing LabGroupsLabGroups have many different levels of membership: Managers, FULL_CONTROL, READ/WRITE, and READ. Managers can add or remove LabGroup Members while every other access level cannot. If you hold the Manager role in a LabGroup, you can add and remove users using the Manage LabGroups (https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/obj/labgroup/list/)  page, which is available under the Manage menu at the top of the page. After selecting a LabGroup, you can add users by typing their username into the search field and selecting a membership role.Section: Requesting a LabGroupTo request a LabGroup for your project, please  contact staff.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=OBJ&oldid=11801"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/SecureShell has the title Section: SecureShell and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSecure Shell (or SSH (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) ) is a network protocol allowing two computers to exchange data securely over an insecure network.  By default, use of SSH brings the user to a terminal, but the protocol can be used for other types of data transfer such as SFTP and SCP.Section: Contents1 Connecting to an SSH Server2 X11 Forwarding3 SSH Tunneling4 SSH Keys (and Passwordless SSH)5 Verify remote host SSH fingerprint5.1 Windows / PuTTY Verification5.2 Other Platforms6 Long Running Processes7 Further InformationSection: Connecting to an SSH ServerUnder Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus.# ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduNote: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.This will give you access to a terminal on any one of the Nexus servers.  Note that by default you will not have access to applications that require X11 to run.All UMIACS-supported Windows hosts are installed with PuTTY (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) . If you are using a self-supported machine, you can either download and install PuTTY yourself, or if you are running a currently supported version of Windows (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education) , you can install the OpenSSH client natively in Windows by following Microsoft's instructions here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) . Only the client is needed and not the server.Section: X11 ForwardingBy default, SSH only gives the user shell access to a host.  Enabling X11 Forwarding allows users to run applications with Graphical User Interfaces.Under Linux and macOS, the following command from a terminal will connect a client computer to the UMIACS Nexus using X11 Forwarding. Please note that under macOS, xQuartz (http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)  is required on the client machine to forward X sessions from the remote session.# ssh -Y username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduNote: Your Nexus submission node will vary depending on your sponsorship. See Nexus Access for more information.Under Windows, you will need to forward X through VcXsrv (http://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)  or another X11 application.If using PuTTY, you will need to enable X forwarding. The option is under Connection > SSH > X11, shown below.If using the Windows Terminal app (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) , you will need to set an environment variable and then relaunch the app.setx.exe DISPLAY "127.0.0.1:0.0"After this has been done, every time you want to use X forwarding, you need to make sure VcXsrv or your other application has been started. If using VcXsrv, there will be an icon in your system tray.You will now be able to use Xwindow programs from your SSH client.Section: SSH TunnelingYou can tunnel one or more ports through an SSH connection such that your packets will look like they are coming from the host you are tunneling to.   This is helpful for services that you would be normally blocked by a firewall.Please see the SecureShellTunneling page for more information.Section: NoneSSH can utilize public key encryption to authenticate and authorize users. This can be considered more secure especially if you secure your private key with a pass-phrase. The keys themselves are not susceptible to brute force attacks like normal passwords over SSH are.Please see the SSH/Keys page for more information.Note: UMIACS still requires multi-factor authentication if you are connecting from the public internet for security reasons. If you first connect to our VPN, you should then be able to use the keys as normal.Section: Verify remote host SSH fingerprintThe SSH protocol relies on host keys to verify the identify of a given host.  Each host as a unique key for the various different protocols supported.  When connecting to a remove host for the first time, or when the remote host's local host key configuration has changed, you may see the following prompt:$ ssh username@nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.eduThe authenticity of host 'nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (128.8.121.73)' can't be established.RSA key fingerprint is 25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f.Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?It is considered best practice to verify the key fingerprint with the actual key of the host.  UMIACS maintains a reference of SSH key fingerprints available at the following link: https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys (https://intranet.umiacs.umd.edu/hostkeys) It is important to note that each key type has a different fingerprint.  Depending on your local configuration, your client may prefer a specific type of key.  The following commands can be used to determine the fingerprint of a given key type on a remote host:$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu > key# nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.0$ ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f key2048 MD5:25:83:aa:df:f5:ad:5f:08:c9:8a:a3:5d:97:8b:48:1f nexusgroup00.umiacs.umd.edu (RSA)If you have any questions, or notice a discrepancy, please  contact staff.Section: NoneIf you use PuTTY to connect to remote hosts, the prompt will be similar to the following:If the host key reported by PuTTY matches the Documented entry for that host (https://gitlab.umiacs.umd.edu/staff/ssh-fingerprints/blob/master/fingerprints) , it is safe to click 'yes'.  If they do not match, please report the issue to staff@umiacs.umd.edu (mailto:staff@umiacs.umd.edu) .Section: Other PlatformsWinSCP (https://winscp.net/eng/docs/faq_hostkey) MobaXterm (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) Section: Long Running ProcessesIf you are dealing with a long running process that is inhibiting your ability to work regularly, you may want to run your processes inside a screen on the host that you're connecting to. This way, if the connection is dropped for any reason the screen session will automatically detach on the host and will continue running so that you can reattach it at a later time when you've connected again. Please see our documentation on  GNU Screen for more information.Section: Further InformationOpenSSH (https://www.openssh.com/) OpenSSH on Windows (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=SecureShell&oldid=12048"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/PrinterQueueNaming has the title Section: PrinterQueueNaming and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Printer QueuesUMIACS uses a centralized print server to manage all of the printers in the Institute.  See Printing for more details specific to your OS.  We have developed a naming scheme for our printer queues based on the colors the printer can produce, the type of queue, the building number, and the room number.The naming scheme is as follows:All color printers begin with a "c".  Black & white is the default so nothing extra is needed.Then either "ps" for a PostScript-enabled queue or "pcl" for a Printer Command Language-enabled queue will appear.  PostScript and PCL are types of printer drivers.  If you are unsure what this means, use "ps" for PostScript.  PCL drivers may not always be available.Then add the building number and a dash ("-"). E.g. add "432-" for IRB, "115-" for AVW, or "224-" for ATL.Then add the room number. E.g. If the printer is in room 3208, add "3208".Some examples:ps432-3208 is a black & white printer in Iribe 3208.cps224-3261 is a color printer in Atlantic 3261.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=PrinterQueueNaming&oldid=10783"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Malware/virus_removal has the title Section: Malware/virus removal and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSection: Contents1 Free malware/virus removal tools2 Online vs Offline Scanners2.1 Online Scanners2.2 Offline/Bootable Scanners3 UMIACS-Supported Machines3.1 How to a run manual F-Secure ScanSection: NoneFor non-UMIACS supported systems, there are several virus and malware protection and removal tools available. This page lists and describes some of them. Note: these are just a few of the many available anti-virus removal tools. One can always search the internet for a well-reputed anti-virus program and use that instead.Section: Online vs Offline ScannersThere are two types of malware/virus removal tools, online and offline. The main difference between the two is that offline scans work outside of your computer's operating system. This can provide an alternate means for detecting and mitigating threats that may use various tactics to hide from your installed antivirus. On the other hand, online scanners can detect most problems while also being easier to use. Most online scanners have better interfaces than their offline counterparts, and they are usually easier to set up and run. Thus, the best way to remove malware or a virus would be to first try an online scanner and see if the issue still persists. If the online scanner did not fix the problem, then you should try an offline scanner. Below are some links to various online and offline scanners.Section: Online ScannersF-Secure Online Scan (https://www.f-secure.com/en/home/free-tools/online-scanner) The online scanner helps to get rid of viruses and spyware that may cause problems on your PC.Malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) This free version is limited, but can also perform malware and virus scans.Section: NoneMicrosoft Defender Offline (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-protect-my-pc-with-microsoft-defender-offline-9306d528-64bf-4668-5b80-ff533f183d6c) This offline scan only works with machines using Windows 10 or 11.Section: UMIACS-Supported MachinesAll UMIACS-supported machines have F-Secure Client Security installed. Follow the steps below to run a manual scan using F-Secure on a UMIACS-supported machine.Section: How to a run manual F-Secure Scan Open F-Secure Client Security by searching it in the search bar. This should open the F-Secure menu in a popup window in the bottom right of your desktop. If it doesn't, try clicking the up arrow in the bottom right and selecting the F-Secure icon. Note that this screen will always say that your computer is not fully protected. This is because we do not run the Browsing Protection optional feature of the F-Secure suite, as it can cause website accessibility issues. If you click on the More Details link and the checkboxes other than the one that says Turn on Browsing Protection are all green, F-Secure is operating normally.  Click on the Manual scanning option in the bottom left side of the window (magnifying glass with a bug in it icon). This will show you your options for manual scanning.  Choose either Malware scan or Full computer scan.Malware scan: Searches common places where malware can be found. This makes it faster, but it may miss some hidden malware.Full computer Scan: Scans all internal/external hard drives for malware. This makes it more thorough than the malware scan, but it can take a long time to complete. After choosing an option, another screen should pop up that shows the progress of the scan.   Once the scan is complete, it will provide a report stating whether any malware was found. If if did find malware, then it will show you the number of files it removed. You can click View scanning report to see more details about specific files.  Click the Close button to close the scan window and complete the scan.Retrieved from "https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php?title=Malware/virus_removal&oldid=10834"〙〘The following url: https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/umiacs/index.php/Snapshots has the title Section: Snapshots and contains the following info: From UMIACSJump to navigationJump to searchSnapshots are a implementation of copy-on-write (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)  that allows for a file system to quickly take a point-in-time copy of the file system and provide access to the data through a .snapshot directory. Snapshots provide a fast, user-accessible way to recover data that has been accidentally deleted or corrupted within a recent time window, rather than having to retrieve the data from comparatively slow tape backups. They also help to span the time gap between  full backups.We provide snapshots on our Isilon, ZFS, VAST, and Qumulo filers to certain file systems. If you are ever unsure if a particular volume has snapshots enabled, please contact the  Help Desk.Section: Snapshot Retention PolicyOur core file systems are on a 4 hour snapshot cycle.

This will turn on the display(s) for the room and lower the projector screens if any are present.Once the startup completes, you will see a number of different options depending on what the capabilities of the room are:Section:  Moderated RoomsThese (larger) rooms have a number of options for sources to display and multiple places to display them to. All of the source options available in the smaller conference rooms are also available in these rooms. The exact options on each moderated room's panel may vary, as the capabilities vary room to room.Of note in these rooms specifically is the "Device Control" option at the top of the source/destination menu, which takes you to another menu where you can manage volume, and (in some rooms) lighting, microphones, and settings for other integrated devices such as the room's Blu-ray player, TV tuner, or room cameras. This is also where you mute or unmute the lectern mic, if there is one.Section:  Auto-Accept RoomsThese rooms have the ability to display an external device's screen wirelessly using  Solstice, an external device's screen wired via HDMI, or the room PC's screen (the room PC is attached to the back of the display in the room).Section:  Huddle RoomsThese rooms have the ability to display an external device's screen wirelessly using  Solstice or wired via HDMI. They do not have room PCs, so you must bring your own device(s).Section: Common OptionsThe three source options you will commonly choose from on these panels are "Solstice", "Laptop Device" (just "Laptop" on some panels), and "Room PC" (the third option only in non-huddle rooms).In auto-accept and huddle rooms, the volume control for each of these sources can be found one you select that source. In moderated rooms, the volume control is on the Device Control menu, as mentioned above.Section: SolsticeThis option will prompt you to look at the display in the room for instructions on how to display your device(s) to the room's display wirelessly. More specific instructions can be found  here. Note that the room-specific details (IP address, room code) have been blacked out in the below photo for privacy reasons, but will show properly when you are physically in a room.Section: Laptop DeviceConnect your device to either the HDMI cable or VGA/aux cables coming out of the middle of the desk in the room to display your device to the room's display over a wired connection.Section: Room PCUse the wireless keyboard/mouse combo on the desk in the room to use the room PC. Choose the Conference account to sign into, which does not need a password. Please be sure to log off when you are done using the room PC, as the account is fully wiped when you log off, ensuring the next group using the room does not have access to anything you may have signed into.Section: Shutting DownPlease be sure to touch the "Shutdown A/V System" button when you are done using the room to save energy and give the next group using the room a clean slate.

Once you create your website in OBJ, you will need to set your directory Home Page to the bucket's URL (the URL that ends in umiacs.io).Section: Nexus File SpaceThis service has been deprecated.This is primarily a legacy method for users who already have their websites configured this way. If you believe that your circumstances require your personal website to be hosted on this file space, please contact the  Help Desk. (This does not affect existing users who already have websites hosted on the Nexus file space.)You will need set your directory Home Page attribute to http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~username (http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~username) , where username is your UMIACS username (similar to your personal URL above). You can access your website for editing in two ways:From Unix as /fs/www-users/username - and can be remotely accessed via SFTP to a supported UNIX host.From Windows as \\umiacs-webftp\www-users\username - and remotely accessed by the same file share over the VPN.Section: Adding A Password Protected Folder To Your Web SpaceThis method will NOT work in the UMIACS Object Store.1) Create the directory you want to password protect or cd into the directory you want to password protect.2) Create a file called .htaccess ( vi .htaccess) in the directory you wish to password protect.3) In the file you just created, type the following lines AuthUserFile "/your/directory/here/".htpasswdAuthName "Secure Document"AuthType Basicrequire user usernameFor example, if you were going to protect the /fs/www-users/username/private directory and you want the required name to be class239, then your file would look like this:AuthUserFile /fs/www-users/username/private/.htpasswdAuthName "Secure Document"AuthType Basicrequire user class2394) Create a file called .htpasswd in the same directory as .htaccess. You create this file by typing in htpasswd -c .htpasswd username in the directory area to be protected.In the example above, the username is class239 so you would type htpasswd -c .htpasswd class239You will be prompted to enter the password you want.
